It then loops through the bytes (using `get()` method), and converts each byte to a 2-digit hex string using the `String.format()` method. The resulting hex strings are concatenated using a `StringBuilder`. Finally, the concatenation is enclosed in Unicode escape sequence syntax, using the `\\u{...}` syntax.\n\nThis approach ensures that the supplementary character is represented using a single Unicode escape sequence, as per the Unicode specification, and hence should pass the test.",

The `escapeChar` method is used to escape all other characters according to the rules of XML/HTML escaping. It also handles invalid surrogate pairs properly (by outputting the character as is), and escapes all control and format characters (including the non-printable ones).",
