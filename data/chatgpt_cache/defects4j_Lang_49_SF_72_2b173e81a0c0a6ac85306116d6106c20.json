If the original fraction had a negative denominator, then the resulting reduced fraction could have a negative numerator.\n\nTo fix this problem, we still need to take the absolute values of the numerator and denominator before computing the greatest common divisor. However, we also need to adjust the sign of the numerator if the original fraction had a negative denominator:\n\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    int numeratorSign = numerator < 0 ? -1 : 1;\n    int denominatorSign = denominator < 0 ? -1 : 1;\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    int reducedNumerator = numeratorSign * Math.abs(numerator) / gcd;\n    int reducedDenominator = denominatorSign * Math.abs(denominator) / gcd;\n    return Fraction.getFraction(reducedNumerator, reducedDenominator);\n}\n```\n\nThis code should correctly compute the reduced fraction while ensuring that the resulting numerator is always positive.",
