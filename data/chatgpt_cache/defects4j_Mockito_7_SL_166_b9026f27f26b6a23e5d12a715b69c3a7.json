Could you please provide more information or context about the code?\n\nHowever, assuming that the issue is related to the `getActualTypeArgumentFor` method, one possible fix for the code could be:\n```java\n        private void readTypeVariables() {\n            for (Type type : typeVariable.getBounds()) {\n                registerTypeVariablesOn(type);\n            }\n            Type actualTypeArg = getActualTypeArgumentFor(typeVariable);\n            if (actualTypeArg != null) {\n                registerTypeVariablesOn(actualTypeArg);\n            }\n        }\n```\nThis fix checks if the actual type argument is not null before trying to register it. If it is null, it skips the registration step, which could be causing the `MockitoException` in the failing test.",
