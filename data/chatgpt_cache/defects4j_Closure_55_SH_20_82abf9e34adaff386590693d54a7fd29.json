After further analysis, it seems that the correct hunk for the first code snippet is:\n```java\n  private boolean hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode) {\n    List<DiGraphEdge<Node, Branch>> branchEdges = getCfg().getOutEdges(cfgNode);\n    for (DiGraphEdge<Node, Branch> edge : branchEdges) {\n      if (edge.getValue() == Branch.ON_EX || edge.getValue() == Branch.ON_EX_RESULT) {\n        return true;\n      }\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n```\nThis additional condition, `edge.getValue() == Branch.ON_EX_RESULT`, covers cases where the exception may be caught and handled within the same function.\n\nAs for the second code snippet, after reviewing the original test failure, it appears that the correct fix is:\n```java\n  private static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    return n.isFunction() && !NodeUtil.isCall(n);\n  }\n```\nThis ensures that we only consider function nodes and exclude call nodes.",
