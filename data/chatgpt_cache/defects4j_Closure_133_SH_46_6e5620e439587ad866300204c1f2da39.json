However, based on the test error message, the issue may be related to the `stream` variable and its usage in the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method. \n\nAssuming that the `stream` variable is some sort of input stream or buffer that the method reads from, the infill location could be modified to handle the case where the buffer is empty. One possible fix for the method could be:\n\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  if (stream.hasRemaining()) {\n    return stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n  } else {\n    return \"\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis modification checks if there are remaining characters in the `stream` buffer and returns an empty string if there are not. This should prevent the `IllegalStateException` from being thrown when the `parse()` method is called. However, without additional context it is difficult to determine if this fix will fully resolve the issue.",
