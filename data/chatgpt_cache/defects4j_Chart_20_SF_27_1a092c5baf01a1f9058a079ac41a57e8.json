The correct color is the `outlinePaint`, which was not being used previously. By passing it as the fourth argument to the constructor, it solves the problem without any additional complexity.\n\nNote that options 2-9 also work, but they introduce unnecessary complexity by adding an additional condition or function call, or by setting the outline paint twice. Option 10 is incorrect because it does not set the outline paint at all.",
