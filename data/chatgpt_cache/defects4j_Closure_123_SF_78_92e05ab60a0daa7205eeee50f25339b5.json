However, I can provide some general guidance to resolve the issue.\n\nThe \"illegal start of type\" error indicates that there is a syntax error in the code, possibly due to mismatched braces or parentheses. It could also be due to a missing import statement or a missing closing bracket or semicolon.\n\nTo fix the issue, carefully review the code and look for any syntax errors such as missing or extra braces, parentheses, or semicolons. Check for missing import statements and make sure all required libraries are imported correctly.\n\nIf you are still having trouble resolving the issue, please provide more information and code examples to help me better understand the problem.",
