The correct hunk for the first code snippet is:\n```java\n        return 100 * doubleValue();\n``` \n\nAnd for the second code snippet, the correct hunk would depend on the implementation of the `solve` method, but one possible fix for the `NullPointerException` error could be to add a null check for the `f` parameter before trying to use it:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    \n    if (f == null) {\n        throw new NullPointerException(\"UnivariateRealFunction is null\");\n    }\n    return solve(min, max);\n}\n``` \nThis would ensure that the method will not throw a `NullPointerException` when the `f` parameter is null.",
