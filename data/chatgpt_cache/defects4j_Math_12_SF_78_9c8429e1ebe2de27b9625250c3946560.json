Based on the limited information provided, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the compilation error without seeing the full code and context.

Make sure that the inputs to the function are valid and not causing unexpected behavior.\n3. Check for any inefficient code that may be causing the timeout.\n4. Consider refactoring or restructuring the code to improve performance.\n\nIf the issue persists, it may be best to seek further assistance from someone with access to the full codebase and context of the problem.",
