The error message suggests that the issue is with the type of a variable. Therefore, I would suggest placing a correct type definition at the infill location.\n\nA possible fix for the issue could be to change the previously removed line to the following:\n```java\n        JSDocInfo.Builder jsdocBuilder = JSDocInfo.builder().recordParseStart(lineNumber);\n``` \nThis line correctly initializes a new instance of the `JSDocInfo.Builder` class and sets the `recordParseStart()` method to `lineNumber`.\n\nI hope this helps!",
