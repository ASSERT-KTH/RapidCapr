The correct hunk to fix the `NullPointerException` issue and compile error would be as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    return availableLocaleList().contains(locale);\n}\n\nprivate static List<Locale> availableLocaleList() {\n    String[] availableLocaleArray = Locale.getISOLanguages();\n    List<Locale> availableLocaleList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for(String language: availableLocaleArray) {\n        availableLocaleList.add(new Locale(language));\n    }\n    return availableLocaleList;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation returns a List of available locales by calling `Locale.getISOLanguages()`, which is a method that retrieves all available ISO languages. Then, the code adds each language as a Locale object to the `availableLocaleList`. By using this implementation, this should solve the `NullPointerException` issue and compile error.",
