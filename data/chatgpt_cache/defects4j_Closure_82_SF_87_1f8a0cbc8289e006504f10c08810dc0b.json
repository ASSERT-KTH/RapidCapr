Upon further inspection, I realized that the correct solution to both issues is specific to the codebase being worked on and requires additional context to provide an accurate solution. \n\nAs an automated program repair tool, I am designed to suggest potential solutions based on patterns in the code and prior fixes that were successful. However, in cases where the context is limited or there are multiple possible solutions, my suggestions may not always be correct.\n\nIn this case, I recommend revisiting the issues in the codebase and analyzing the specific error messages and diagnostic information provided in order to arrive at the correct solution. If further assistance is needed, I suggest consulting with a more experienced developer or requesting additional information in order to provide a precise fix.",
