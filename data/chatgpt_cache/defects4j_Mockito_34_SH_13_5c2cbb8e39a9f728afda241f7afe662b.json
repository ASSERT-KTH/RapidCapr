Therefore, the loop should be guarded with a check to ensure the array is non-empty before trying to access it. Here is the corrected hunk:\n\n```java\n        int k = 0;\n        Object[] args = i.getArguments();\n        for (Matcher m : matchers) {\n            if (m instanceof CapturesArguments && args.length > k) {\n                ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(args[k]);\n            }\n            k++;\n        }\n```  \n\nThis prevents the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` from occurring by ensuring that the loop only executes if the `args` array is non-empty and contains at least `k+1` elements.",
