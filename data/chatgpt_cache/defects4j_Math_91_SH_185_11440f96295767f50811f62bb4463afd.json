The correct fix hunk depends on the implementation of the `Fraction` class and the expected behavior of the `compareTo` method. The infill location suggests that the `doubleValue` method was used to convert the numerator and denominator of `this` and `object` to a double value, which was then used for comparison. However, none of the provided fix hunks use the `doubleValue` method. \n\nTo generate an alternative fix hunk, more information is needed about the `Fraction` class and the expected behavior of the method.",
