The correct hunk to fix the issue is:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n        return availableLocaleList().contains(locale);\n}\n```\nThis implementation calls the `availableLocaleList()` method which returns a list of available locales, and then checks if the specified `locale` is present in that list using the `contains` method. This should fix the NPE issue and provide the correct functionality.\n\nAs for the second buggy hunk, since there was no code provided, I am unable to provide a fix.
