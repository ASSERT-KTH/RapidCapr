Using `doubleValue()` method may lead to precision errors for large numbers. A better approach would be to use long values for calculation. Therefore, the correct hunk could be:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n```\n\nwhich first calculates the numerator of the first fraction multiplied by the denominator of the second fraction and numerator of the second fraction multiplied by the denominator of the first fraction and then compares them to get the result. This approach should avoid precision errors and provide correct results.",
