The correct formula is `(observed - expected)^2 / expected`, where `observed` and `expected` are arrays of observed and expected frequencies.

The `isPositive()` check was checking if all values in the `expected` array were positive, but it should have been checking if any value was zero or negative. The `isNonNegative()` check was checking if any value in the `observed` array was negative, but it should have been checking if all values were non-negative. The corrected code fixes these issues and should pass the failing test.",
