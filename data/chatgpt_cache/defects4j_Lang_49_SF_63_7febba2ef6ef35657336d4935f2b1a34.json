Here's another fix to the `reduce` method that should address the issue:\n\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    numerator /= gcd;\n    denominator /= gcd;\n    return new Fraction(numerator, denominator);\n}\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, just like the previous versions. If the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in reduced form and can be returned as-is. Otherwise, the numerator and denominator are updated by dividing them by the GCD. Finally, a new `Fraction` instance is returned with the updated numerator and denominator. This should correctly address the issue and pass the `testReduce` test.",
