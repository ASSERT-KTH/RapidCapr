The expected result is `-1` but the actual result is `0`. Therefore, we need to modify the logic to properly compare the fractions. \n\nOne possible fix could be to compare the difference between the two fractions instead of comparing their decimal values:\n\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd - dOn, 0);\n    }\n```\n\nThis fix computes the difference between the two fractions without converting them to decimals. It then compares the difference with zero using the `Long.compare` method which returns `-1`, `0`, or `1` based on the sign of the difference. \n\nPlease note that this is just one possible fix, and there could be other valid alternatives.",
