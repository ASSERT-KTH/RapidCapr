The `nOd` and `dOn` variables are used to get the decimal value of the fractions to compare them. \n\nOne possible fix for the bug could be to compare the products `numerator * object.denominator` and `denominator * object.numerator` instead of their decimal values. \n\nTherefore, the correct hunk to replace the removed buggy hunk is:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long)denominator * object.numerator;\n```\n\nThis hunk ensures that the products of the numerator of `this` and the denominator of `object`, and the denominator of `this` and the numerator of `object` are compared as long values, and not as double values which could be imprecise due to floating-point representation issues.",
