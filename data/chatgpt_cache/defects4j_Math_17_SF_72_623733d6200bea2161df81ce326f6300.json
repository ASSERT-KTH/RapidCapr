However, the error message suggests that the function is not handling NaN values correctly. One possible fix could be to check for NaN values before performing the multiplication and returning a NaN value if the input is NaN. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    if (isNaN()) {\n        return newInstance(getField(), getNanSign());\n    }\n    return multiplyFast(x);\n}\n```",

If the number is not NaN, it performs the multiplication using the `multiplyFast` method and returns the result.",
