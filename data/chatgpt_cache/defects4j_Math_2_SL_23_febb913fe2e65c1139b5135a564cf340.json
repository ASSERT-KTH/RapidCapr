                    "content": "Based on the error message and the fact that the value of `sample` is negative, it seems like the issue could be that the `getNumericalMean()` method is returning a negative value, which is causing the assertion to fail. Therefore, we can rule out options 1, 2, and 3 as they do not handle negative values correctly.\n\nOption 4 checks for a population size of 0, but it still allows for a negative value of `getSampleSize()` to be returned. Therefore, we can rule out option 4 as well.\n\nOption 5 and 6 both handle negative values correctly, so they are possible solutions. However, option 5 also allows for a sample size less than 0, which may not be desirable.\n\nOption 7 is a good solution as it not only handles negative values, but also checks for a sample size of 0 and returns `Double.NaN`.\n\nOption 8 is also a good solution as it similarly checks for negative values and returns `Double.NaN` if either value is less than or equal to 0.\n\nOption 9 is a simple solution that only checks for a population size less than or equal to 0, but it does not handle negative values.\n\nOption 10 handles negative values, but it also allows for a negative value of `getNumberOfSuccesses()` to be returned, which may not be desirable.\n\nOption 11 is similar to option 8, but it does not handle sample sizes less than 0.\n\nOption 12 handles negative values and also checks that the sample size is not larger than the population size. However, it may not be necessary to check that the sample size is less than or equal to 0.\n\nGiven these options, one possible solution would be to use option 7:\n```java\n    public double getNumericalMean() {\n        if (getPopulationSize() == 0) {\n            return 0.0;\n        } else if (getSampleSize() == 0) {\n            return Double.NaN;\n        } else {\n            return ((double) getSampleSize() * (double) getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n        }\n    }\n```",
