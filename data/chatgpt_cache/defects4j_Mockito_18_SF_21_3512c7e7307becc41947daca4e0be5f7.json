Without seeing more of the code, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the `values.returnValueFor(Iterable.class)` method is returning `null`, hence causing the `NullPointerException`. You can add a null check to it before calling its `iterator()` method. Here's an example fix:\n\n```java\nObject iterableObj = values.returnValueFor(Iterable.class);\nif (iterableObj == null) {\n    iterableObj = Collections.emptyList();\n}\nIterable iterable = (Iterable) iterableObj;\nassertFalse(iterable.iterator().hasNext());\n```",
