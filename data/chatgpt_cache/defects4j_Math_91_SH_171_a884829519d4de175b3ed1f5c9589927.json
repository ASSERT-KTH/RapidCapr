This suggests that the fraction being compared is equal or greater than the other fraction, when it should be less.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to correctly calculate the difference between the two fractions. One possible hunk that can fix this issue is:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\n\ndouble diff = (double)nOd / (double)dOn;\n\nreturn diff < 1 ? -1 : (diff > 1 ? +1 : 0);\n```\n\nThis calculates the difference between the two fractions by multiplying the numerator of the current fraction with the denominator of the other fraction, and vice versa. It then calculates the quotient of these two products and returns -1 if the quotient is less than 1 (i.e., the current fraction is less than the other fraction), +1 if the quotient is greater than 1 (i.e., the current fraction is greater than the other fraction), and 0 if the quotient is equal to 1 (i.e., the fractions are equal).",
