It's possible that there is another error earlier in the code that is causing this compilation error.\n\nWithout seeing more of the code, it's difficult to provide an exact fix. However, some possible causes of this error could be:\n\n- A missing semicolon or closing brace earlier in the code\n- A missing method or variable declaration\n- A syntax error in an earlier line that is causing the compiler to incorrectly interpret subsequent lines\n\nI recommend reviewing the code for any syntax errors and double-checking that all variables and methods are properly declared. Additionally, check the lines before the reported error to see if there are any missing semicolons or other syntax errors.",
