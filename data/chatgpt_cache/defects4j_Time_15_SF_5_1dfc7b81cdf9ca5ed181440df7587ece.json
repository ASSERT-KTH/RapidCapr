If `val1` is `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `val2` is -1, it throws an exception. Otherwise, it computes the multiplication of `val1` and `val2` and checks if the result has the same sign as `val1` and if the division of the result by `val2` is equal to `val1`. If these conditions are not met, it throws an exception. If the conditions are met, it returns the result. This ensures that the multiplication does not overflow a long.",
