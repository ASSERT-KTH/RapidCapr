Unfortunately, without access to the code and context in which it is used, I cannot guarantee a working solution.\n\nHowever, a possible fix for the timeout issue is to optimize the code by improving its efficiency. This can involve reducing unnecessary computation, avoiding redundant calculations, optimizing loops, and leveraging concurrency to process data in parallel. \n\nAnother approach could be to increase the timeout limit for the test. This would give the program more time to execute and complete the test successfully. However, this solution is not recommended as it may mask underlying performance issues in the program.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the code, including its size, complexity, and purpose, I may be able to provide more specific advice.",
