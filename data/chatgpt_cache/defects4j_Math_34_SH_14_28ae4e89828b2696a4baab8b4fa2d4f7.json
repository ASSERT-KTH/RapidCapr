This means that the original implementation was likely returning a mutable iterator, which is not supported.\n\nA possible fix hunk could be to return an iterator that is backed by the immutable list of chromosomes:\n```java\n    public Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n        return Collections.unmodifiableList(chromosomes).iterator();\n    }\n``` \n\nThis ensures that the returned iterator is immutable and therefore calling any mutation methods on it will result in an UnsupportedOperationException.",
