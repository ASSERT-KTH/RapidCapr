Therefore, the multiplication should be performed as long to avoid overflow.\n\nAn alternative fix line may be:\n```java\nfinal double n1n2prod = ((double) n1) * n2;\n```\nThis line is also correct because it casts `n1` to `double` before performing the multiplication to ensure that the result is computed in floating-point arithmetic and avoid rounding errors. However, it is less efficient than the previous line since it involves casting `n1` to `double` instead of casting `n1` and `n2` to `long` which is faster.",
