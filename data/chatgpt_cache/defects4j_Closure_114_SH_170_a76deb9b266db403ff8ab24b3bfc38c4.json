                    "content": "Based on the information given, it seems like the bug is related to associating the right-hand side of an assignment with the caller expression, causing incorrect reference edges between referenced and assigned variables. Therefore, we can fix the bug by only associating the right-hand side with the caller expression if it is not nested deeper in the caller. This can be done by checking if the parent of the recordNode is a function call, and only recording the dependency scope if it is not.\n\nThe alternative fix hunk would be:\n```java\n        } else if (recordNode.getParent().isCall() && recordNode.getParent().getFirstChild() == recordNode) {\n            recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);\n        } else {\n            recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        }\n```\nThis checks if the parent of the recordNode is a function call and if the recordNode is the first child of the function call, which means it is the caller expression. If this is the case, we record the dependency scope with the nameNode instead of recordNode. Otherwise, we record the dependency scope with the recordNode. This should fix the bug while still recording the correct dependency scopes.",
