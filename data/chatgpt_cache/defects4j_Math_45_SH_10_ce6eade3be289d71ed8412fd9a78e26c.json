One possible fix is to modify the constructor to handle large input values by resizing the hashmap accordingly. Here is a potential fix:\n\n```java\npublic OpenMapRealMatrix(int rowDimension, int columnDimension) {\n    super(rowDimension, columnDimension);\n    this.rows = rowDimension;\n    this.columns = columnDimension;\n    int expectedSize = Math.max(1, (int) Math.ceil(rowDimension * columnDimension * 0.01)); // Resize hashmap to 1% of expected entries\n    this.entries = new OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(expectedSize, 0.0);\n}\n```\n\nThis fix resizes the hashmap to account for the expected number of entries, but limits it to 1% of the total size to avoid potential memory issues. It also sets the default value for missing entries to 0.0 as before.",
