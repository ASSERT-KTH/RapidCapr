To make the best suggestion, I will need to analyze the codebase and understand the purpose of the `Week` constructor and the context in which it is used. However, I can provide some general suggestions:\n\n1. If the original hunk was causing the failure, it might be useful to try adding it back and see if that resolves the test failure. However, it is possible that the failure is caused by a different issue, in which case the original hunk might not be the correct fix.\n\n2. If the issue is related to time zones, as suggested by the use of the `TimeZone` parameter, it might be worth investigating how the time zone is being handled in other parts of the code and using that as a guide for fixing the constructor.\n\n3. It might also be useful to look at any other failed tests or error messages that are related to the `Week` class to get a better sense of how the constructor is being used and what issues might be affecting it.\n\n4. Finally, it might be helpful to consult with other developers who are familiar with the codebase or have experience with similar issues to see if they can provide guidance or suggestions for fixing the problem.",
