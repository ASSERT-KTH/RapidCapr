However, here is a possible fix hunk:\n\n```java\nthis(new Date(time.getTime() + zone.getRawOffset()), zone);\n```\n\nThis hunk creates a new `Date` object by adding the time zone's raw offset to the given time, and then passes that new `Date` object and the given time zone to the constructor of `Week`. This should ensure that the week is calculated correctly with the specified time zone, and may address the test failure. However, it's important to note that this may not be the best or most correct fix depending on the full context of the code and its requirements.",
