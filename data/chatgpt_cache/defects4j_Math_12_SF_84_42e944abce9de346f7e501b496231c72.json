Unfortunately, without access to the full codebase, I am unable to determine the cause of the timeout error and provide a fix. \n\nA timeout error generally indicates that the function is taking too long to execute, possibly due to an infinite loop or a large computational load. One possible solution is to optimize the function's performance by reducing unnecessary computations, evaluating expressions in a different order, or using more efficient data structures. \n\nIf you can provide more information about the codebase and the function in question, I may be able to provide more specific recommendations.",
