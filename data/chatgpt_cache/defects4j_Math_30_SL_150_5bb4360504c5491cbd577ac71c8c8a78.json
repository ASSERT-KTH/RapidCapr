The infill location is missing crucial information about the type of the variables `n1` and `n2` and the desired type of the result. If `n1` and `n2` are both integers, the product `n1 * n2` must be computed using a long variable to avoid integer overflow. If `n1` or `n2` is a floating-point number, the product can be computed as a floating-point number. Therefore, the following alternative fix lines are suggested:\n\n1.
