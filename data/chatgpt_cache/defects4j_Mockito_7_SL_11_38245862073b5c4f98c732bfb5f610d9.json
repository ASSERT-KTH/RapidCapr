One possibility is to add a null check before trying to extract the actual type argument:\n```java\n        Type actualTypeArg = getActualTypeArgumentFor(typeVariable);\n        if (actualTypeArg != null) {\n            registerTypeVariablesOn(actualTypeArg);\n        }\n``` \nThis would skip the extraction process and avoid the null pointer exception when the type argument is null.
