It uses the `translate(input, pos, out)` method, which returns the number of code point units consumed when processing characters for translation.\n\nIf the code point at the current position is a surrogate character, `translate` writes the Unicode escape sequence for the character to the output, instead of writing the character itself. This fixes the issue with the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when invoking `StringEscapeUtils.escapeCsv(\"\\uD83D\\uDE30\")`.\n\nI hope this solution works for you!",
