If they are, it returns true since the program specifies that NaN values are considered equal. If either value is not NaN, it compares the absolute difference between the values to a very small tolerance value. If the absolute difference is less than the tolerance, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. This allows for a small amount of rounding error in the floating-point values.",
