To fix the issue, you can return an iterator that supports the `remove()` method by adding the `remove()` implementation to the code. Here's the fixed code:\n\n```java\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return new Iterator<Chromosome>() {\n        Iterator<Chromosome> it = chromosomes.iterator();\n        \n        @Override\n        public boolean hasNext() {\n            return it.hasNext();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Chromosome next() {\n            return it.next();\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public void remove() {\n            it.remove();\n        }\n    };\n}\n```",
