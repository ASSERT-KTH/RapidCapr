Therefore, the test `testLang645` was failing because it was expecting the output to be \"fredag, week 53\" but it was actually \"fredag, week 01\".\n\nIn order to fix this issue, we can create the `GregorianCalendar` instance with the time zone and locale information by using the `getInstance` method of `Calendar` class. Therefore, the corrected hunk can be either of the above mentioned hunks.",
