Please add a closing curly brace at the end of the `evaluateStep` function. Here is the corrected function with the missing curly brace added:\n\n```java\npublic boolean evaluateStep(final StepInterpolator interpolator)\n        throws DerivativeException, EventException, ConvergenceException {\n    try {\n\n        forward = interpolator.isForward();\n        final double t1 = interpolator.getCurrentTime();\n        final int n = Math.max(1, (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(t1 - t0) / maxCheckInterval));\n        final double h = (t1 - t0) / n;\n\n        double ta = t0;\n        double ga = g0;\n        double tb = t0 + (interpolator.isForward() ? convergence : -convergence);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n            // evaluate handler value at the end of the substep\n            tb += h;\n            interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(tb);\n            final double gb = handler.g(tb, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n\n            // check events occurrence\n            if (g0Positive ^ (gb >= 0)) {\n                // there is a sign change: an event is expected during this step\n\n                // this is a corner case:\n                // - there was an event near ta,\n                // - there is another event between ta and tb\n                // - when ta was computed, convergence was reached on the \"wrong side\" of the interval\n                // this implies that the real sign of ga is the same as gb, so we need to slightly\n                // shift ta to make sure ga and gb get opposite signs and the solver won't complain\n                // about bracketing\n                // this should never happen\n\n                // variation direction, with respect to the integration direction\n                increasing = gb >= ga;\n\n                final UnivariateFunction f = new UnivariateFunction() {\n                    public double value(double t) {\n                        try {\n                            interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(t);\n                            return handler.g(t, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n                        } catch (DerivativeException e) {\n                            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n                        } catch (EventException e) {\n                            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n                        }\n                    }\n                };\n\n                final BrentSolver solver = new BrentSolver();\n                solver.setAbsoluteAccuracy(convergence);\n                solver.setMaximalIterationCount(100 * maxIterationCount); // increase the maximum iterations\n                final double root = (ta <= tb) ? solver.solve(f, ta, tb) : solver.solve(f, tb, ta);\n                if ((Math.abs(root - ta) <= convergence) &&\n                        (Math.abs(root - previousEventTime) <= convergence)) {\n                    // we have either found nothing or found (again ?) a past event, we simply ignore it\n                    ta = tb;\n                    ga = gb;\n                } else if (Double.isNaN(previousEventTime) ||\n                        (Math.abs(previousEventTime - root) > convergence)) {\n                    pendingEventTime = root;\n                    if (pendingEvent && (Math.abs(t1 - pendingEventTime) <= convergence)) {\n                        // we were already waiting for this event which was\n                        // found during a previous call for a step that was\n                        // rejected, this step must now be accepted since it\n                        // properly ends exactly at the event occurrence\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                    // either we were not waiting for the event or it has\n                    // moved in such a way the step cannot be accepted\n                    pendingEvent = true;\n                    return true;\n                }\n\n            } else {\n                // no sign change: there is no event for now\n                ta = tb;\n                ga = gb;\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        // no event during the whole step\n        pendingEvent = false;\n        pendingEventTime = Double.NaN;\n        return false;\n\n    } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n        final Throwable cause = e.getCause();\n        if ((cause != null) && (cause instanceof DerivativeException)) {\n            throw (DerivativeException) cause;\n        } else if ((cause != null) && (cause instanceof EventException)) {\n            throw (EventException) cause;\n        }\n        throw new EventException(e);\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nI hope this helps!",
