The proposed hunks don't take into account this specific behavior, so I would suggest the following fix:\n\n```java\nif (ns != null && !(parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent))) {\n  if (!n.getParent().isCall()) {\n    recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis fix keeps the `parent.isFor()` check and adds a check for whether the current node's parent is a function call. If it is, then we don't record the dependency scope because the RHS of the assignment will be immediately invoked and can't be considered as being used in the same context as the LHS. The `ns != null` check is also moved to the beginning of the condition for clarity and to avoid redundancy.",
