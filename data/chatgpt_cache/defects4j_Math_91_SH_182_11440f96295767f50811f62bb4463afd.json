                    "content": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the original buggy hunk was computing the double values of the numerator and denominator of two fractions being compared, but it was removed for some reason. Therefore, a reasonable fix might be to restore that computation with a slight modification to avoid possible loss of precision due to floating-point arithmetic. One way to do this is:\n\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = (long) numerator * object.denominator;\n        long dOn = (long) object.numerator * denominator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n    }\n```\n\nThis fix computes the products of numerators and denominators as long integers, which can represent the full range of values with exact precision. Then, the comparison between these products is done using the `Long.compare` method, which returns -1, 0, or +1 depending on whether the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second argument, respectively. This implementation should work correctly for most inputs, except possibly when the products of numerators and denominators exceed the range of `long` integers, which is rare and depends on the magnitudes of the fractions being compared.",
