It's possible that the function is taking too long to complete or is stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nWithout further information on the specific code and the test cases being run, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. Here are some general tips for improving the performance of code:\n\n- If there are any loops or recursive calls, make sure they terminate properly and aren't stuck in an infinite loop.\n- Look for any unnecessary computations or duplicate calculations that can be optimized, such as using memoization if applicable.\n- Consider using a profiler tool to identify performance bottlenecks in the code.\n- Ensure that the input values are within reasonable ranges to avoid overly large calculations or infinite loops.\n- Consider splitting the function into smaller, more manageable units that can be tested and optimized separately.\n\nI hope this helps in improving the function's performance and resolving the timeout error.",
