A proper fix requires knowledge about the purpose of the `Week` constructor and the behavior of the program. However, I can provide some guidance on how to approach the problem.\n\nTo fix the failing test, you need to ensure that the `Week` object constructed has a week number of 35 instead of 34. This suggests that the bug is related to how the week number is calculated.\n\nYou can start by analyzing how the `getWeek()` method calculates the week number and what inputs it depends on. Then, examine the original buggy hunk that was removed and how it initializes the `Week` object. The missing hunk should then focus on correcting the inputs being passed to the `Week` constructor to ensure that the `getWeek()` method correctly calculates the week number.\n\nYou may also want to verify that the fix is correct by running the entire test suite and checking if any other tests fail.",
