One possible implementation is to compare the difference between the two fractions directly by cross-multiplying the numerator of one fraction with the denominator of the other and vice versa. Therefore, the correct hunk for the infill location could be:\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * object.denominator - object.numerator * this.denominator;\nlong dOn = this.denominator * object.numerator - object.denominator * this.numerator;\n``` \nThis implementation computes the difference between the two fractions and sets the numerator and denominator of the fraction difference as `nOd` and `dOn`, respectively. These values can be used to determine the sign of the difference and hence the result of the comparison.",
