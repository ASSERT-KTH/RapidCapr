Here is the corrected implementation:\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    if (x < 0 || x >= RADIX) {\n        return multiply(newInstance(x));\n    }\n    return multiplyFast(x);\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe original code was failing because `multiplyFast` assumes the value of `x` is within the range `0` and `RADIX-1` inclusive. Therefore, we need to check if the value of `x` falls outside this range and handle it accordingly. In the corrected code, we use an `if` statement to check if `x` is outside the range. If `x` is outside the range, we create a new `Dfp` object using `newInstance(x)` and call the `multiply` method. If `x` is within the range, we call the `multiplyFast` method directly.",
