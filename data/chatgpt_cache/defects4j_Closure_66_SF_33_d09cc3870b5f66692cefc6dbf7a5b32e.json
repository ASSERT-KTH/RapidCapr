However, based on the test error message, it seems like the `getTypedPercent` function is not returning the expected percentage. To fix this, you may need to review the implementation of the `getTypedPercent` function and identify any issues that could be causing incorrect percentage calculations. Ensure that you are using the correct formula for calculating the percentage and that you are correctly processing the input to the function. Additionally, you may need to check that all the corner cases are handled properly.",
