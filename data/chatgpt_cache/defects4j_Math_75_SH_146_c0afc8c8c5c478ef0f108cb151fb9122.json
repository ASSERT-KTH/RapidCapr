However, as per the error message, it seems that a symbol cannot be found. This is likely because the method `getCumPct` may not be visible in the current scope. The fix could be to import the class where `getCumPct` is defined or to make the method public/visible. \n\nYou can try the following hunk at the infill location:\n```java\nimport <package_name>.<class_name>; // Replace package_name and class_name with actual package and class names\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n        return <class_name>.getCumPct((Comparable<? super T>) v);\n}\n```\nOr, if `getCumPct` is not defined in any class, you can try making the method public in its current class. \n\nAgain, without seeing the complete code or context, it's difficult to provide an exact fix.",
