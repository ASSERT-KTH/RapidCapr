                "content": "I apologize for the mistake. After further investigation, it appears that the issue is with the `contains` method and not with the locale. The `contains` method is not comparing the strings correctly when they contain non-ASCII characters. Therefore, I suggest replacing the entire method with the following code:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean containsIgnoreCase(String str, String searchStr) {\n    if (str == null || searchStr == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    final int length = searchStr.length();\n    if (length == 0) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    for (int i = str.length() - length; i >= 0; i--) {\n        if (str.regionMatches(true, i, searchStr, 0, length)) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses `regionMatches` to compare substrings of the input strings. The second argument, `true`, indicates that the comparison should be case-insensitive. The loop iterates over all candidate starting positions for the search string, and checks if that substring matches the search string using `regionMatches`.\n\nI hope this solution resolves the issue.",
