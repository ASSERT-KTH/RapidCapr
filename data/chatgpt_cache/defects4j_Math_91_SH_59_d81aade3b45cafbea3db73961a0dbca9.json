                    "content": "Based on the error message and the test case, the issue seems to be with the comparison logic in the `compareTo()` method. The method should return -1 if the current `Fraction` object is less than the `object` parameter passed to it, 1 if the current object is greater than the `object`, and 0 if they are equal. \n\nOne possible fix could be to compare the product of numerator of the current object and the denominator of the `object` with the product of the denominator of the current object and the numerator of the `object`. If the former is less than the latter, the current object is less than `object`.\nTherefore, the correct hunk at the `INFILL` location could be:\n```java\ndouble nOd = this.numerator * object.denominator;\ndouble dOn = this.denominator * object.numerator;\n```\n\nThis hunk will compute the product of the numerator of the current object and the denominator of the `object` and store it in `nOd`, and the product of the denominator of the current object and the numerator of the `object` and store it in `dOn`. This will help correctly compare the two fractions.",
