Here is an updated fix for the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method based on the exception message you provided:\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n    String result = \"\";\n    try {\n        result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\n        // handle exception\n        System.err.println(\"Error while parsing JSDoc line: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis will catch the `IllegalStateException` that is being thrown and print an error message to `System.err`, which may help you diagnose what is causing the issue during JSDoc parsing. If you have a specific way that you want to handle this exception, you can replace the `System.err.println()` statement with your own custom code.",
