Here are some possible reasons that could cause this error:\n\n- The removed line might be in the wrong class or interface. Check if the removed line is in the correct scope.\n- The syntax of the code might be incorrect, causing the compiler to fail. Check if there are any missing brackets or semicolons in the code.\n\nWithout seeing the full code and error message, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution.
