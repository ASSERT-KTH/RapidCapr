                    "content": "Based on the context and the test failure, it looks like the bug occurs when an assignment statement is inside a function call with the assigned variable being used in the call. In such a case, the current code is associating the namespace of the assigned variable with the entire function call instead of just the assignment statement. \n\nTo fix this, we should only associate the namespace of the assigned variable with the assignment statement if it's not inside a function call or if the assigned variable is not used in the function call. Therefore, my suggested fix at the infill location is:\n\n```java\n        } else if (!n.getParent().isCall() || !NodeUtil.isExpressionNode(n) || !NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(n.getFirstChild().getNext())) {\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n```\n\nThis code checks if the parent node of the assignment statement is not a function call or if the assignment statement is not an expression node or if the assigned variable is not used in the function call. If any of these conditions is true, we record the dependency scope for the assigned variable with the assignment statement. Otherwise, we skip recording the dependency scope for this assignment statement.",
