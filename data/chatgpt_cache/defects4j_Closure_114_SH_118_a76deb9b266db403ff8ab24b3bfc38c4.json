                    "content": "Based on the provided code and test case, it looks like the issue is that the recordDepScope method is being called twice in the if statement block. The first call is correct, but the second call is incorrect and causing the test case to fail.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can simply remove the second call to recordDepScope and replace it with an else if block to check if the parent node is a call node. If it is a call node, we can skip associating the rhs node with the lhs node.\n\nHere's the fix:\n\n```java\n    private void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n      Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();\n      Node parent = n.getParent();\n      NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);\n      if (ns != null) {\n        if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n          // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n          // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.  Without\n          // this change, all 3 of those parts try to claim the for\n          // loop as their dependency scope.

Don't associate it w/ the lhs.\n          // FYI: this fixes only the specific case where the assignment is the\n          // caller expression, but it could be nested deeper in the caller and\n          // we would still get a bug.\n          // See testAssignWithCall2 for an example of this.\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nThis fix adds an else if block to check if the parent node is a call node. If it is a call node, we skip the second call to recordDepScope.",
