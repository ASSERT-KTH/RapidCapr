Based solely on the error message and the fact that the test is failing on a week number, it seems that the problem is related to the week number calculation. It's possible that the week number calculation might be off by one due to different definitions of the first week of the year in different locales.\n\nHere's the updated code to replace the INFILL location to handle this issue:\n\n```java\nc.setTime(date);\nc.setFirstDayOfWeek(Calendar.MONDAY);\nc.setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(4); // or 1, or any other relevant value\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\n\nThis sets the first day of the week to Monday, as is typically used in many locales, and sets the minimal number of days in the first week of the year to a relevant value according to the used locale, which should fix the week number calculation.",
