In order to further diagnose the problem, I would need to see the implementation of the `greatestCommonDivisor` method.\n\nIn the meantime, here is an alternative implementation for the `reduce` method that should work correctly:\n\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    if (numerator == 0) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));\n    int reducedNumerator = numerator / gcd;\n    int reducedDenominator = denominator / gcd;\n    if (reducedDenominator < 0) {\n        reducedNumerator = -reducedNumerator;\n        reducedDenominator = -reducedDenominator;\n    }\n    return Fraction.getFraction(reducedNumerator, reducedDenominator);\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation first checks if the numerator is already 0, in which case it returns the original fraction as is. Otherwise, it finds the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the numerator and denominator, and divides both by that value. It then checks if the reduced fraction has a negative denominator, and if so, flips the signs of both numerator and denominator.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the earlier mistakes and I hope this implementation will fix the issue.",
