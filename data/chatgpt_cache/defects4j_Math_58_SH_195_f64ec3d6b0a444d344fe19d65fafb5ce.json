It seems that the issue is not with the `fit` method but rather with the `guess` array.\n\nThe `guess` array is being generated by calling the `ParameterGuesser.getGuess` method, which is returning an array of zeros. This is causing the `fit` method to fail as it requires non-zero values in the `guess` array.\n\nTo fix this, you can modify the `guess` array to have non-zero values using the `ParameterGuesser.getGuess` method, like this:\n\n```java\nfinal double[] guess = new ParameterGuesser(getObservations()).guess();\nfor (int i = 0; i < guess.length; i++) {\n    if (guess[i] == 0) {\n        guess[i] = 1;\n    }\n}\nreturn fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n```\n\nThis code sets all zeros in the `guess` array to 1 to ensure that the `fit` method can run successfully.",
