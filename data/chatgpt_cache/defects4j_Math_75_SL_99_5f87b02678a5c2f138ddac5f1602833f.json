However, based on the test failure you provided, it seems that the percentage calculation may be incorrect. Here is another possible fix that could solve the issue:\n```java\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    double total = getCount();\n    double count = getCount((T) v);\n    return count / total;\n}\n```\nThis will calculate the percentage by dividing the count of the input element by the total count, and return it as a double value.
