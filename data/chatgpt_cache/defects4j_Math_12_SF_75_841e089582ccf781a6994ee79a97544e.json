If the fix I provided did not resolve the issue and the code is still timing out during the test, there may be other underlying issues that need to be addressed. Without being able to see the full codebase and debug the issue, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the timeout. \n\nHowever, one recommendation I can give is to optimize the code by identifying any sections that may be causing the time-out and finding ways to optimize or refactor those sections. This could include techniques such as caching repeated computations, simplifying complex logic, or implementing concurrency where appropriate.\n\nAnother recommendation is to increase the timeout limit of the test execution environment if possible, to allow for longer test runs if needed.\n\nIf you can provide more details or the relevant code sections, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide additional suggestions for resolving the issue.",
