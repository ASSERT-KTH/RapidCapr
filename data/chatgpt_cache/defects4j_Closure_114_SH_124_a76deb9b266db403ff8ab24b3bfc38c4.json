                    "content": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the bug is related to assignments used as caller expressions. Hence, the correct fix hunk could be to modify the `if` condition to exclude such cases. Here is a possible fix:\n\n```java\n        } else if (!NodeUtil.isCall(parent)) {\n          // The rhs of the assignment is the caller, so it's used by the\n          // context.

This ensures that the rhs of the assignment is not associated with the lhs in the case of caller expressions. Note that the comment has been updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nI hope this helps!",
