After investigating the issue further, it appears that the infilled line I provided in my previous response is not sufficient to fix the test failure.\n\nThe error message you're seeing suggests that there is an issue with bad position information. This might indicate that there is a problem with the way some positioning information is being recorded.\n\nWithout having access to the full codebase and more information about the error, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, here are some general suggestions that may help you track down the issue:\n\n- Check the stack trace to see if it provides more information about which part of the code is causing the error.\n- Try debugging the program to see which line of code is causing the error.\n- Check the codebase for any instances where position information is being recorded and make sure that it is being done correctly.\n- If the error only occurs in certain scenarios, try to isolate those scenarios and see if that gives you any clues about what is causing the issue.\n\nI hope that helps.
