Therefore, an alternative fix hunk could be as follows:\n\n```java\nif (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n  // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n  // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.  Without\n  // this change, all 3 of those parts try to claim the for\n  // loop as their dependency scope.

If this is the case, it only records the dependency scope for the left-hand side of the assignment statement when the parent node of the assignment expression is not a `CALL` expression.",
