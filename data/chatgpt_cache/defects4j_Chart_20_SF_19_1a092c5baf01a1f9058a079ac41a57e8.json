                    "content": "Based on the error message and the provided code, it seems that the issue is with the constructor parameter order of `ValueMarker`. The constructor currently sets the outline paint twice with the same argument and does not set the correct outline paint passed in as a parameter. \n\nA possible fix would be to reorder the constructor parameters and ensure that the outline paint and stroke passed in as parameters are properly set. Here is a potential fix:\n\n```java\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke,\n                   Stroke stroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);\n\n    this.value = value;\n    \n    if (outlinePaint != null) {\n        setOutlinePaint(outlinePaint);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis constructor takes in the value, fill paint, outline paint, outline stroke, fill stroke, and alpha. By reordering the parameters, we can properly set the outline paint and stroke. By default, the fill paint and stroke will be set as expected, but the outline paint and stroke should be set with the passed-in parameters. \n\nIn this fix, we set the fill paint and stroke with the `super()` call. Then, we set the outline paint only if it is non-null. Finally, we set the value for this marker and return. \n\nThis should fix the error and properly set the outline paint and stroke.",
