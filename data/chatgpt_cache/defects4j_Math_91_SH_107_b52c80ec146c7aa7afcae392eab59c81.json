                    "content": "Based on the error message and the given test case, it seems that the `compareTo` method is not returning the expected value. We need to calculate the numerical difference between the current fraction and the `object` fraction, and return -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the difference is negative, zero, or positive, respectively. Therefore, we can fix the code by subtracting `object`'s value from the current fraction's value and comparing the result with 0. Here's the fix:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double diff = doubleValue() - object.doubleValue();\n    if (diff < 0) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if (diff > 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nThis fix calculates the difference between the current fraction and the `object` fraction, and returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on whether the difference is negative, zero, or positive, respectively. The calculation of the difference is done by subtracting `object`'s double value from the current fraction's double value. This should resolve the error and pass the test.",
