This could be done using the numerator and denominator of each fraction as follows:\n\n```\ndouble nOd = numerator * object.denominator;\ndouble dOn = denominator * object.numerator;\n```\n\nAlternatively, a fix could involve using long integers instead of doubles to prevent precision errors:\n\n```\nlong nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long)denominator * object.numerator;\n```\n\nUltimately, the best fix depends on the details of the Fraction class implementation and the specific requirements of the project.",
