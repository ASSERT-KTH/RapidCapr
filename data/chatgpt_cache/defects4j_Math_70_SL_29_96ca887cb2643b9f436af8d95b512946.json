If there is, it calls the `solve` method with the original `min` and `max` parameters. If not, it tries to solve the function by dividing the interval `[min, max]` into two subintervals, `[min, initial]` and `[initial, max]`. If neither of these intervals contain a root, then the function returns `Double.NaN`.",
