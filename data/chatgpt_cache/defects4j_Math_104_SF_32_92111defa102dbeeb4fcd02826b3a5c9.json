However, based on the test error message, it appears that there's a small difference between the expected value and the actual value. This could be due to differences in floating-point arithmetic. Increasing the epsilon value in the `assertEquals` method may resolve the issue. \n\nAlternatively, if the bug is related to the implementation of the function itself, a possible fix would be to review and revise the calculation logic.",
