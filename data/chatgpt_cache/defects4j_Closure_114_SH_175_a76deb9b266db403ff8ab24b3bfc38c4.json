If it is the first child, then it means that it is being used as the function name in a function declaration. In that case, the assignment should be associated with the function name instead of the right-hand side expression. \n\nIf `n` is not the first child, then it must be an argument passed to a function. In that case, the assignment should be associated with the right-hand side expression. However, we also need to check if the parent is a call expression or not. If the parent is not a call expression, then it means that the right-hand side expression is not actually being used as an argument, but instead is used somewhere else (like assignment to a variable). In that case, we still associate the assignment with the right-hand side expression. \n\nThis fix addresses the issue in the given test case and also accounts for other potential scenarios where the same issue could arise.",
