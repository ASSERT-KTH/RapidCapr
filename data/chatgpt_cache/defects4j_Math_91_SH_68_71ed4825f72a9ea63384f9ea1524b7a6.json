The correct implementation should compare the fractions based on their actual values, rather than their double representations. \n\nHere's a fix hunk that uses the cross-multiplication method to obtain the numerators and denominators of the fractions being compared:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\nreturn Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n```\n\nThis implementation first calculates the numerator of the left fraction multiplied by the denominator of the right fraction (`nOd`), and the numerator of the right fraction multiplied by the denominator of the left fraction (`dOn`). It then compares the two products using `Long.compare` to return either a negative, zero or positive value to indicate the result of the comparison. \n\nThis implementation avoids using floating-point arithmetic and should correctly compare fractions that have large or small numerators and denominators.",
