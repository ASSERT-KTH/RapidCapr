Looking at the original buggy hunk, it seems that `doubleValue()` method is used to convert the numerator and denominator to doubles and then compared. However, this would not work correctly in all cases due to precision issues. \n\nA better approach would be to compare the fractions numerically by cross-multiplying them and comparing the resulting numerators. \n\nTherefore, the correct hunk is:\n```java\n        long nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = object.numerator * (long)denominator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n``` \nThis cross-multiplies the fractions and compares the resulting numerators using `Long.compare()` method which returns -1, 0, or 1 based on the comparison result.",
