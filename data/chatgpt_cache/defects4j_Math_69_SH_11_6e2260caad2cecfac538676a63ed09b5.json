Upon further inspection of the failing test case, it seems that the correct hunk at the infill location should be the original buggy code:\n\n```java\nout[i][j] = 2 * (1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t));\n```\n\nThis line of code estimates the p-value for the correlation coefficient `r` using a t-distribution. A p-value is the probability of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than the observed result, assuming that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no correlation).\n\nThere may be a few reasons why the test case is still failing: (1) there is an issue with the test case itself (e.g., incorrect input values), (2) there is a different bug in the code that is causing the test case to fail, or (3) the code is correct but the test case needs to be revised to accept the new output values.\n\nIf you could provide more context on the failing test case and any error messages or stack traces associated with it, I can try to provide more guidance on the issue.",
