                    "content": "Based on the test failure and the context of the removed buggy hunk, it seems that the bug is related to associating the right-hand side (RHS) of an assignment with the calling context. Therefore, a possible fix hunk could be to check if the parent of the assignment node is a call expression, and if so, do not record the RHS of the assignment as a dependency in the same scope as the left-hand side (LHS) variable. The alternative fix hunk is:\n\n```java\n        } else if (!n.getParent().isCall()) {\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        }\n```\n\nThis fix hunk adds an additional check to the original buggy hunk that verifies the parent of the assignment is not a call expression. If the parent is not a call expression, then the fix hunk behaves as before and records the RHS of the assignment in the same dependency scope as the LHS variable. If the parent is a call expression, the fix hunk does not record the RHS as a dependency in the same scope.\n\nThis way, the fix avoids associating the RHS of an assignment with the LHS variable when the assignment is part of a call expression. Since the test case that fails calls a function that captures a variable assigned outside the function, this fix hunk avoids creating a dependency that should not exist, providing a more accurate dependency graph.",
