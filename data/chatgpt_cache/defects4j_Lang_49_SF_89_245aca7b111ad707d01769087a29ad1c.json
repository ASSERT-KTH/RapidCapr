It seems I missed an important detail in the original question. \n\nThe issue with the `reduce()` method is that the numerator and denominator variables are not updated after reducing the fraction with the greatest common divisor. The correct implementation should be:\n```java\n    public Fraction reduce() {\n        int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n        numerator /= gcd;\n        denominator /= gcd;\n        return this;\n    }\n```\nThis code updates the numerator and denominator in place and returns the modified instance of `Fraction`, satisfying the `assertEquals` assertion of the test case.",
