This fix ensures that the value of `n1n2prod` will be stored as a `double`, and thus prevents the potential for integer overflow if the product of `n1` and `n2` is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This is a safer fix compared to simply casting the product to a `long`, as it creates less overhead and precision loss.",
