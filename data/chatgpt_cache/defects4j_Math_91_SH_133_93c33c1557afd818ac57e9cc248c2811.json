From the original buggy hunk, it looks like the `nOd` and `dOn` variables are used to compare the fractions based on their double values. \n\nTo fix the issue, we need to calculate the double values of the fractions correctly. A possible fix hunk could be:\n\n```java\ndouble nOd = (double) numerator / denominator;\ndouble dOn = (double) object.numerator / object.denominator;\n```\n\nThis calculates the double values correctly by dividing the numerator by the denominator for each fraction. Then, we can use these values to compare the fractions:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = (double) numerator / denominator;\n    double dOn = (double) object.numerator / object.denominator;\n    return Double.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\n\nThis uses the `Double.compare` method to compare the double values. This fix hunk should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.",
