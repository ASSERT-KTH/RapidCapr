In the while loop, if `consumed` is 0, then the current codepoint needs to be written to the output, but `pos` only gets incremented by 1 even though the current codepoint may have more than one character. To address the issue, we should use `Character.charCount()` to determine how many characters the current codepoint takes up, as follows:\n\n```java\npublic final void translate(CharSequence input, Writer out) throws IOException {\n    if (out == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The Writer must not be null\");\n    }\n    if (input == null) {\n        return;\n    }\n    int pos = 0;\n    int len = input.length();\n    while (pos < len) {\n        int consumed = translate(input, pos, out);\n        if (consumed == 0) {\n            int codePoint = Character.codePointAt(input, pos);\n            char[] c = Character.toChars(codePoint);\n            out.write(c);\n            pos += Character.charCount(codePoint);\n        } else {\n            pos += consumed;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease update the code with this method and let me know if it resolves the issue.",
