                    "content": "Based on the error message, it seems that the current implementation is returning 0 instead of -1 for the `pi1.compareTo(pi2)` test case, indicating that `pi1` should be less than `pi2`. This means that `nOd` (numerator divided by denominator) is equal to `dOn` (other fraction's numerator divided by denominator), which is incorrect. Therefore, we need to adjust the calculation of `nOd` and `dOn` to get the correct comparison.\n\nHere is an alternative fix hunk:\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = (long)this.denominator * object.numerator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n    }\n```\n\nThis implementation multiplies the `numerator` of the current fraction with the `denominator` of the other fraction to get `nOd` and multiplies the `numerator` of the other fraction with the `denominator` of the current fraction to get `dOn`. Both of these calculations are casted to `long` to avoid potential overflow. We then use `Long.compare()` to compare `nOd` and `dOn` and return the result.\n\nThis implementation should correctly compare two fractions and pass the failing test case.",
