Upon inspecting the code further, I see that the issue may lie elsewhere. \n\nIt seems that the `IllegalStateException` is caused by the `JSLineParser`, which expects the `ts` field to be the index of the current character in the source code, but it ends up being `-1` when it shouldn't be.\n\nI suggest modifying the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method to set `stream.ts` to the correct value before returning the remaining JSDoc line. Here's the modified code:\n\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n\n    // add this line to update the ts field in the stream\n    stream.ts += result.length();\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis should fix the issue with the `IllegalStateException` and pass the failing test.",
