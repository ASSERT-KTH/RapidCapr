Therefore, I propose the following hunk to fix the issue:\n\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        // Calculate the cross products\n        long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\n\n        // Compare the cross products\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n    }\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly calculates the cross products and compares them to determine the ordering of the fractions. It also uses `Long.compare` to properly handle any overflow or underflow that may occur during the comparison.",
