However, you could try the following potential solutions:\n\n1. Simplify the function or refactor it to improve its efficiency.\n2. Make sure that the function is not stuck in an infinite loop or recursion.\n3. Check if the function is dependent on external state or resources that could be causing delays or blocking.\n4. Optimize any loops or algorithms in the function to reduce the overall execution time.",
