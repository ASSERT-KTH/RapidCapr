Rewrite the constructor to take in a Week number instead of a Date and TimeZone object. This would ensure that the Week number is correctly calculated in the constructor.\n\n2. Check the implementation of the `getWeek()` method to see if it is correctly calculating the Week number. If not, fixing the implementation of this method may solve the issue.\n\n3.
