    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution being incorrect. Without access to the full codebase and the specific test cases being run, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix. However, based on the error message you provided, the test is timing out after 300 seconds. This could be an indication of an infinite loop or a very long and inefficient calculation being performed within the `multiply` function.\n\nOne possible solution could be to improve the efficiency of the `multiply` function by optimizing its code or using a different algorithm to perform the multiplication.\n\nWithout further information about the specific code and error, I am unable to provide a more specific solution.",
