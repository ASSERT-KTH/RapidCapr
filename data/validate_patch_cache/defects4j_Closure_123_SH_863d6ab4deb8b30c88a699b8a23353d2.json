    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous suggestion. Based on the error message you provided, it seems like there may be a syntax error in the code.\n\nWithout seeing the full context or source code it's difficult to provide an exact hunk to fix the issue. However, I can provide some general tips for resolving \"illegal start of type\" errors:\n\n1. Check for missing/extra braces, parentheses, or curly braces: Make sure you have closed all opening braces/parentheses/curly braces and removed any extra closing braces/parentheses/curly braces.\n\n2. Check for missing semicolons: Java requires semicolons to terminate most lines of code. Double check that all lines of code are terminated properly.\n\n3. Check for typos: Sometimes a small typo, like misspelling a keyword or variable name, can cause a \"illegal start of type\" error.\n\n4. Make sure imports and packages are properly defined: Ensure that all necessary import statements and package declarations are included in your code.\n\nI hope these tips help you resolve the issue. If you can provide more information or the full code file, I'd be happy to provide more specific help.",
