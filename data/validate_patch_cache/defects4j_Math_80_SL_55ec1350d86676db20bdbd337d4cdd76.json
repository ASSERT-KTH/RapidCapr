    "patch": "Based on the context of the code, the correct fix line seems to be:\n```\nint j = 4 * (n - 1) + pingPong;\n```\nThis is because the loop runs in steps of 4, and `j` should be initialized to the index of the last element in the block of 4 elements to be swapped. Since there are `n` blocks of 4 elements to be swapped, and the loop starts at index 0, `j` should be initialized to `4 * (n - 1)` plus `pingPong`, which is the index of the last element in the previous block of 4 elements. An alternative fix line could be:\n```\nint j = 4 * n - 1 - pingPong;\n```\nThis initializes `j` to the index of the last element in the block of 4 elements to be swapped similar to the original buggy line, but also takes into account the `pingPong` value. However, it is possible that this may not work as intended in all scenarios, as the exact role of `pingPong` in the code is not clear without additional context.",
