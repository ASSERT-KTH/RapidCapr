After reviewing the original test case and examining the code more closely, I have determined that the correct fix for the first hunk is to replace it with the following:\n\n```\nprivate boolean hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode) {\n    List<DiGraphEdge<Node, Branch>> branchEdges = getCfg().getOutEdges(cfgNode);\n    for (DiGraphEdge<Node, Branch> edge : branchEdges) {\n        if (edge.getEnd().getType() == Token.CATCH) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis code looks for edges in the control flow graph that end in a catch block, and returns `true` if any are found. This approach identifies `catch` blocks correctly, which the previous solution did not. This should fix the issue and pass the original test case.",
