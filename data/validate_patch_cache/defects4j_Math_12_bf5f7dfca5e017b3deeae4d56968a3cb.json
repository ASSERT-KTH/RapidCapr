    "patch": "Unfortunately, without access to the full codebase and more detailed information on the test cases that are timing out, it's not possible to provide a specific solution. One potential approach is to use a divide and conquer strategy to split the input into smaller subproblems and solve them separately before combining the results. This technique can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and potentially avoid timeouts. Here's an example implementation that uses this approach for multiplying two 2D matrices:\n\n```\npublic static int[][] multiply(int[][] a, int[][] b) {\n    int n = a.length;\n    int[][] c = new int[n][n];\n    if (n == 1) {\n        c[0][0] = a[0][0] * b[0][0];\n    } else {\n        int[][] a11 = submatrix(a, 0, 0, n/2);\n        int[][] a12 = submatrix(a, 0, n/2, n/2);\n        int[][] a21 = submatrix(a, n/2, 0, n/2);\n        int[][] a22 = submatrix(a, n/2, n/2, n/2);\n\n        int[][] b11 = submatrix(b, 0, 0, n/2);\n        int[][] b12 = submatrix(b, 0, n/2, n/2);\n        int[][] b21 = submatrix(b, n/2, 0, n/2);\n        int[][] b22 = submatrix(b, n/2, n/2, n/2);\n\n        int[][] c11 = add(multiply(a11, b11), multiply(a12, b21));\n        int[][] c12 = add(multiply(a11, b12), multiply(a12, b22));\n        int[][] c21 = add(multiply(a21, b11), multiply(a22, b21));\n        int[][] c22 = add(multiply(a21, b12), multiply(a22, b22));\n\n        copy(c, c11, 0, 0);\n        copy(c, c12, 0, n/2);\n        copy(c, c21, n/2, 0);\n        copy(c, c22, n/2, n/2);\n    }\n    return c;\n}\n\npublic static int[][] submatrix(int[][] matrix, int row, int col, int size) {\n    int[][] sub = new int[size][size];\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {\n            sub[i][j] = matrix[row+i][col+j];\n        }\n    }\n    return sub;\n}\n\npublic static int[][] add(int[][] a, int[][] b) {\n    int n = a.length;\n    int[][] c = new int[n][n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n    return c;\n}\n\npublic static void copy(int[][] matrix, int[][] sub, int row, int col) {\n    int size = sub.length;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {\n            matrix[row+i][col+j] = sub[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation multiplies two square matrices using the divide and conquer technique and returns the resulting matrix. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the size of the input matrix. However, by splitting the input into smaller subproblems, the function can reduce the time complexity and potentially avoid timeouts. You can modify this example implementation to fit your specific use case and input data.",
