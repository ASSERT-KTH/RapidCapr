    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the entirety of the code and the specific test cases that are causing timeouts, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. \n\nIn general, timeouts occur when the program takes too long to execute, which can happen due to a variety of reasons like heavy computation, infinite loops, etc. My suggestion would be to try and identify the specific test cases that are causing the timeouts and analyze them in detail to figure out the possible performance bottlenecks in the code. \n\nYou can also consider implementing some performance optimization techniques like caching, memoization, parallelism, etc. to make the program run faster. Alternatively, you can consider splitting the computations into smaller chunks and processing them in batches to avoid timeouts.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or code to work with, I would be happy to assist you further.",
