Since the code is missing and I do not have any other context to work with, I cannot provide a specific solution to the error you are encountering. \n\nHowever, the error message \"class, interface, or enum expected\" typically occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as a missing opening or closing parenthesis, brace, or bracket. Please review the code for any syntax errors and try to resolve them. \n\nIf you are still encountering issues, please provide more information about the code and any error messages you are receiving, and I will do my best to assist you.",
