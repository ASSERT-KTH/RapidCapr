Without seeing the original code, it is difficult for me to determine the exact issue and provide a correct solution. \n\nIf the timeout error is occurring, that suggests there may be an issue with the efficiency of the code and it may be taking too long to complete. In this case, optimization techniques or restructuring the code may be necessary. \n\nCan you please provide more information about the code and the context in which it is being used, as well as any other error messages or warnings that may be present?",
