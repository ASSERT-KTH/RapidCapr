    "patch": "I apologize for the previous suggestion. The timeout issue may be caused by the implementation of the `multiply` method, but without more context and code snippets, it is difficult to provide a definite solution.\n\nIf the issue is with `multiply`, one possibility is to try a different algorithm for the multiplication operation. For example, the Karatsuba algorithm for integer multiplication is known for its speed and efficiency.\n\nAnother possibility is to analyze the underlying data structures and processing steps for possible bottlenecks or inefficiencies. This could involve profiling the code and identifying performance hotspots or memory leaks.\n\nAgain, without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. Please provide more details on the code and context if possible.",
