    "patch": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but I cannot provide the correct function without additional information and code context. A compilation error suggests that there may be issues with the code structure, dependencies, or build process.\n\nHere are some general suggestions to resolve compilation errors:\n\n1. Check for syntax errors: Make sure that the code follows the correct syntax for the programming language. Common issues include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, and undefined variables.\n\n2. Check for missing dependencies: Verify that all required libraries and dependencies are correctly installed and referenced in the build process.\n\n3. Check for build configuration issues: Make sure that the build process is correctly configured for the specific project and development environment. Common issues include incorrect build paths, missing compiler flags, and incompatible operating system requirements.\n\nIf the issue persists, I recommend seeking the help of a more experienced developer or consulting online resources for specific solutions based on the language and framework used in your code.",
