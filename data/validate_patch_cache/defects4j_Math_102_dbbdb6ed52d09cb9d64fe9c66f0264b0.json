Here's an updated version of the `chiSquare()` method without compilation errors and addressing the NaN result issue:\n\n```\npublic double chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed)\n        throws IllegalArgumentException {\n    if (expected.length < 2 || expected.length != observed.length) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"observed, expected array lengths incorrect\");\n    } \n    if (!isPositive(expected) || !isNonNegative(observed)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"observed counts must be non-negative and expected counts must be positive\");\n    }\n    double sumSq = 0.0d;\n    for (int i = 0; i < expected.length; ++i) {\n        if (expected[i] == 0.0 && observed[i] != 0) {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"can't have non-zero observed counts with zero expected counts\");\n        }\n        else if(expected[i] == 0.0 && observed[i] == 0) {\n            //do nothing\n        }\n        else{\n            double diff = observed[i] - expected[i];\n            sumSq += diff * diff / expected[i];\n        }\n    }\n    if (Double.isNaN(sumSq) || Double.isInfinite(sumSq)) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"invalid result\");\n    }\n    return sumSq;\n}\n```\n\nThe main difference in this updated version is the addition of the `else if` statement, which does nothing if the expected value is zero and the observed value is zero. This is added to ensure that the sum of squares is not affected by such data points, which helps to avoid computation issues.\n\nAdditionally, we added validation for non-zero expected values with zero observed values and math evaluation for negative and special values at the end of the function, also preventing the result from being NaN.",
