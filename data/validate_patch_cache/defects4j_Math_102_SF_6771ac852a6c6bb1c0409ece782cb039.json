Here is another possible solution:\n\nThe issue here is that the `isPositive()` method does not check for zero values in the `expected` array. Therefore, we have to add a check for zero values in the `expected` array before computing the chi-square value.\n\nHere is a possible corrected implementation for the `chiSquare()` method:\n\n``` java\npublic double chiSquare(double[] expected, long[] observed) throws IllegalArgumentException {\n    if ((expected.length < 2) || (expected.length != observed.length)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"observed, expected array lengths incorrect\");\n    }\n    if (!isPositive(expected) || !isNonNegative(observed)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"observed counts must be non-negative and expected counts must be positive\");\n    }\n    double sumSq = 0.0d;\n    double dev = 0.0d;\n    for (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) {\n        if (expected[i] == 0.0 && observed[i] == 0L) {\n            // special case for zero values\n            continue;\n        } else if (expected[i] == 0.0 && observed[i] > 0L) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"observed count must be zero when expected count is zero\");\n        }\n        dev = ((double) observed[i] - expected[i]);\n        sumSq += dev * dev / expected[i];\n    }\n    return sumSq;\n}\n```\n\nHere, we added a check for zero values in the expected array using the `expected[i] == 0.0 && observed[i] == 0L` condition. If both values are zero, we simply skip this observation and continue to the next one. We also added a check for zero expected count with non-zero observed count, which is an illegal scenario.\n\nWe hope that this will solve the issue and pass the original test case.",
