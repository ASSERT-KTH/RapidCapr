    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts at fixing the code. Without access to the full code and test cases, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix. \n\nHowever, I suggest trying to optimize the `multiply` function and reducing any unnecessary computations for each multiplication. You can also try using precomputed tables or memoization to optimize the multiplication operation. \n\nAdditionally, the `multiplyFast` method may be worth revisiting to ensure that it is correctly and efficiently handling all cases. \n\nAgain, I apologize for not being able to provide a more specific solution, but I hope these suggestions help you in fixing the compilation error and improving the performance of the program.",
