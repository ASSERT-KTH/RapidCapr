However, as none of the provided hunks are guaranteed to fix the issue, I would suggest performing further analysis of the code. Here are some possible approaches to investigate and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check the implementation of the `getWeek()` method. The error message suggests that the returned week is incorrect. It is possible that the issue is not in the constructor but in the `getWeek()` method. Check the logic in that method to see if there are any errors.\n\n2. Verify the input values passed to the constructor. It is possible that the error is caused by incorrect input values passed to the constructor. Make sure that the values are valid and consistent with the expected format.\n\n3. Debug the code. Use a debugger to step through the code and see which values are being used and computed. This can help identify where the error is occurring and what values are causing it.\n\n4. Modify the constructor code to handle the input values correctly. Based on the analysis of the code, come up with a modification to the constructor code that can handle the input values properly and produce the expected output. Test the modified code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.\n\nBased on the analysis and testing of the code, generate a fix hunk that would correct the code.",
