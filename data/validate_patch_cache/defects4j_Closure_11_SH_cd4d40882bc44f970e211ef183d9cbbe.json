Based on the error message you are seeing, it appears that the infilled code I provided is probably still not correct.\n\nWithout additional context around the code, it's difficult to say exactly what needs to be changed to fix the compilation error. However, based on the error message you're seeing, it's likely that there is a missing closing brace or semicolon somewhere in the code.\n\nCould you please provide more context around the faulty hunk or the entire function, so that I can take a closer look and provide a more accurate fix?",
