    "patch": "Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to the upper bound of the range passed into the `RectangleConstraint`. One possibility is that the upper bound is greater than the constraint's width, causing the error. To fix this, we can replace the infill location with the following line of code:\n\n```\nnew Range(0.0, Math.max(0, constraint.getWidth() - w[2] - w[3]))\n``` \n\nExplanation: The `constraint.getWidth() - w[2] - w[3]` expression calculates the available width for the right block, which should be non-negative. The `Math.max(0, ...)` part ensures that the upper bound of the range is always non-negative. Therefore, the resulting range should satisfy the constraint and prevent the error from occurring.",
