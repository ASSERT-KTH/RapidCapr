    "patch": "I apologize for the continued errors. Can you please provide more context or the full code file? The specific location of the \"illegal start of type\" error is necessary to provide an accurate hunk. Without more information, it's difficult to determine what is causing the error and where the correct hunk should be inserted.\n\nAdditionally, please double check that the code file you provided is the correct one and that there are no other missing hunk(s) in the code file. Sometimes a single missing hunk can cause multiple errors in the code.\n\nOnce I have more information, I'd be happy to provide further assistance.",
