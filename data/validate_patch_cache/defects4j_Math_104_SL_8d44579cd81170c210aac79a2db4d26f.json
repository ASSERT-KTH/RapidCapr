    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake again. It seems like I misunderstood the question earlier. Based on the error message `error: class, interface, or enum expected`, it seems that the buggy line that was removed was a class, interface or enum definition that hasn't been replaced yet. Without seeing the full context of the code, it's difficult for me to determine the exact fix. Can you please provide more context or information on the buggy line that was removed?",
