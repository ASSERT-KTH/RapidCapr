    "patch": "Without access to the full codebase and more detailed information on the test cases that are timing out, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips for addressing this issue:\n\n1. Check if the timeout is caused by a slow test case or slow implementation. You can try running the code and tests locally to see if any specific test case or method is running slowly.\n\n2. Improve performance by optimizing algorithms, avoiding expensive operations, and reducing resource usage. Some potential areas to investigate include cache management, memory usage, and time complexity of algorithms.\n\n3. Utilize tools like profiling and debugging to identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks.\n\n4. Consider parallelization techniques such as multi-threading to improve performance.\n\n5. Split large tests into smaller, more manageable ones to avoid timeouts.\n\n6. Check if the issue is related to the hardware or infrastructure by using different machines or environments to run the tests.\n\n7. If all else fails, consider reaching out to the original developers or maintainers of the code for support in resolving the issue.",
