However, here is an explanation of the original buggy hunk and the two provided fix hunks:\n\nThe original buggy hunk calculated the floating point values of the two fractions and compared them directly, which may cause precision errors. This explains why the test failed with an unexpected result.\n\nThe first fix hunk calculates the numerator of the first fraction multiplied by the denominator of the second fraction and the numerator of the second fraction multiplied by the denominator of the first fraction. This ensures that the fraction values are compared directly without using floating point arithmetic. However, it does not handle negative fractions properly, so it may not work in all cases.\n\nThe second fix hunk calculates the cross product of the two fractions and compares the numerator of the first fraction minus the numerator of the second fraction with the denominator of the first fraction minus the denominator of the second fraction. This also ensures that the fraction values are compared directly, but it handles negative fractions properly by subtracting the values instead of multiplying them. This is the preferred fix hunk.",
