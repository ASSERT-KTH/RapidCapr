    "patch": "Unfortunately, without seeing the full code and understanding the context of the error message, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix. However, here are some general tips that may help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider increasing the timeout value in the test suite to allow the test to complete without a timeout error.\n2. Review the code carefully to identify any potential concurrency or performance issues that may be causing the test to take longer than expected.\n3. Make sure that all dependencies and required resources are available and properly configured for the test to run successfully.\n4. Check that all input parameters and function calls are correct and consistent with the intended behavior of the code.\n5. If possible, try to isolate the specific area of the code that is causing the timeout error, and focus your efforts on optimizing or fixing that specific section.",
