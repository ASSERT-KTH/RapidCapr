    "patch": "I apologize for the previous suggestion not resolving the issue.\n\nWithout seeing the original code that contains the bug and the full stack trace of the error, it's difficult to identify the exact problem in the code. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is timing out and not completing within the allotted time (600 seconds).\n\nOne possible solution could be to optimize the test to run faster. This can be done by removing any unnecessary code or loops, and/or reducing the input size if possible. Alternatively, you can increase the timeout duration in the test configuration to allow for longer test runs.\n\nIf you could provide more information and context, I may be able to assist you in a more specific way.",
