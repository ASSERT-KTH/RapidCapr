It appears to be called inside a loop during the integration process, so this could be a possible source of error.\n\n- Verify the correctness of the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` used in the `classicalRungeKutta` method.\n\n- Double-check the initial state and the values of `scalAbsoluteTolerance` and `scalRelativeTolerance`, as they might affect the step size.\n\n- Verify that the interpolator is storing the right state variables at the right time, as this could affect the accuracy of the computed solutions.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and if possible, please provide more information about the test case to help me identify the issue more accurately.",
