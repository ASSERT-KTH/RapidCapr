This accounts for potential floating point errors.\n\n2. Change the implementation of the `returnFor` method to use the correct type when returning the primitive value. For example, instead of `return (T)primitiveValues.get(clz);`, use `return clz.cast(primitiveValues.get(clz));`.\n\n3. Check for other bugs in the implementation of the `returnFor` method that might be causing unexpected behavior.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these suggestions fix the issue.",
