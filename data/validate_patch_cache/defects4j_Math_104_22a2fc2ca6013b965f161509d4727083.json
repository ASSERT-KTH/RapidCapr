Since there is no context of the code provided, I assumed that the removed hunk was part of a class/interface/enum definition. \n\nBased on the newest error message, it seems that the removed hunk was actually not part of a class/interface/enum definition. Can you please provide more context and information about the location where this hunk was removed from? It will help me better understand the issue and provide the correct hunk.",
