Without seeing the code snippet and the context, it's difficult to suggest an accurate fix.\n\nHowever, based on the error message, it seems like the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out. It's possible that the function needs to be optimized for performance.\n\nOne potential solution could be to look for any unnecessary or redundant operations within the function and remove them. Additionally, you can try to optimize any loops or recursive calls within the function to reduce the overall time complexity.\n\nIf you could provide me with more context and code snippets, I could potentially provide a more accurate fix.",
