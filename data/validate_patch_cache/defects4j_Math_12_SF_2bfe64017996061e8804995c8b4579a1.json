However, without seeing the full code and the test that is causing the time-out error, it is difficult for me to provide a solution. \n\nIt is possible that the issue is not with this particular function, but rather with other parts of the code that are causing the test to fail. I suggest reviewing the entire code and the test suite to identify the root cause of the issue. \n\nIf you can provide me with more information or code snippets, I will be happy to take a closer look and offer suggestions for resolving the time-out error.",
