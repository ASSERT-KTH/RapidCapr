Based on the error message, it looks like the issue is with the `getActualTypeArgumentFor` method.\n\nSince I do not have access to the implementation of this method, I suggest that you check whether it correctly handles the case when the passed-in `TypeVariable` has no actual type arguments. If it does not handle this case properly, you may need to modify it to return an appropriate `Type` object (e.g., `Object.class`) when there are no actual type arguments for the given `TypeVariable`.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide me with more context and information about the `getActualTypeArgumentFor` method, and I may be able to provide a more targeted fix for the issue.",
