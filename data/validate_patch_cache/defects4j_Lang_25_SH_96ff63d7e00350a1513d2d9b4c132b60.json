It seems that my previous answer was incorrect. \n\nWithout additional information about the context and the code, I cannot provide a specific hunk to fix the compilation error. However, based on the error message, it seems that there might be an issue with an assignment operator `=` that is missing an operand. \n\nPlease provide more information about the code and the context, such as the specific line of code that is causing the error, so that I can provide a more accurate solution to the problem.",
