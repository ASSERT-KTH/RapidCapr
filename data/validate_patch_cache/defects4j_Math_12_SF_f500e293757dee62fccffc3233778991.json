    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working. Unfortunately, a timeout error indicates that the code is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized. Without more context or code to work with, I cannot provide a more accurate solution.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for optimizing code to avoid timeout errors:\n\n1. Look for any unnecessary loops or recursive calls and try to simplify or refactor them.\n2. Avoid performing complex operations or calculations within loops.\n3. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize performance.\n4. Look for any redundant code or operations and eliminate them.\n5. Benchmark the code to identify any bottlenecks and focus on optimizing those areas. \n\nI hope this helps. If you can provide more information or context, I would be happy to take another look and see if there are any specific optimizations that can be made.",
