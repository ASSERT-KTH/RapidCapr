    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. Based on the compilation error you provided, it seems that the issue may not be related to the `isAvailableLocale` method itself but rather to another line of code in the file.\n\nWithout more context or information about the code, it's difficult to provide an exact solution to fix the compilation error. However, here are a few general steps you can take to try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check the line number of the error and see what code precedes it. There may be an error on that line or a previous line that is causing the issue.\n\n2. Look for any syntax errors such as missing parentheses or semicolons.\n\n3. Make sure that all variables and methods are correctly defined and have the proper scope and access modifiers.\n\n4. Check for any missing or extra quotes, parentheses, brackets, or other delimiters.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, please provide more information about the code and the error message.",
