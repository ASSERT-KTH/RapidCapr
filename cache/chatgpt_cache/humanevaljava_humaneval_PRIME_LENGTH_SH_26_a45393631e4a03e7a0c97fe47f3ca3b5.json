The original buggy hunk checks if the length of the input string is prime, but it returns `false` for all input strings with a length greater than 2, instead of checking if the length is divisible only by 1 and itself. Therefore, a potential fix for this issue could be:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean prime_length(String string) {\n    int l = string.length();\n    if (l <= 1)\n        return false;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(l); i++) {\n        if (l % i == 0)\n            return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThis new implementation checks if the length of the input string is divisible only by 1 and itself, by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the length and checking if there is any divisor in between.",
