Therefore, I suggest using the following hunk as the fix:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {\n    for (int j = i + 1; j < l.size(); j++) {\n        if (l.get(i) + l.get(j) == 0)\n            return true;\n    }\n}\nreturn false;\n```\n\nThis hunk iterates over all pairs of integers in the list to check if their sum is zero. The inner loop starts from `i+1` to avoid checking pairs that have already been checked before, and the return statement is outside the loops to ensure that all pairs are checked before returning `false` if no pair sums to zero.",
