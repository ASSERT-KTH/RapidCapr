Therefore, I propose the following fix hunk that makes use of the missing method:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    return Double.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n``` \n\nThis updated code should correctly compare the two `Fraction` objects by their double value representation, as returned by the `doubleValue()` method, which converts each fraction into a double and returns its value. By using the `Double.compare()` method to compare the two double values, we can return -1, 0, or 1 as appropriate.",
