Based on the compilation error you reported, it seems that I am still missing something in my code.\n\nAfter further investigation, I have discovered that the error might be caused by the `isBottom()` method, which is not standard Java and must be defined or imported separately in your code.\n\nTo fix the `isEmptyType()` method while resolving the compilation error, I propose the following updated implementation:\n\n```java\npublic final boolean isEmptyType() {\n    return isNoType() || isNoObjectType() || isNoResolvedType() || isBottomType();\n}\n\nprivate boolean isBottomType() {\n    // Define or import the isBottom() method in this helper method.\n    return isBottom();\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, I introduced a `isBottomType()` helper method that calls the `isBottom()` method, which can be defined or imported in your code. The `isEmptyType()` method now calls `isBottomType()` to check whether the type is empty.\n\nI hope this new version of the code resolves the issue.",
