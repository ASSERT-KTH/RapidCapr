However, the original buggy hunk simply returns the input parameter `n`, which does not seem correct based on the error message from the failed test case. Therefore, a possible fix could be to add some logic to calculate a value based on the input parameter `n`. Here is one example implementation:\n\n```java\npublic static int car_race_collision(int n) {\n    // Calculate speed based on input n\n    int speed = n * 2;\n\n    // If speed is higher than 10, add a collision penalty of 5\n    if (speed > 10) {\n        speed += 5;\n    }\n\n    // Return final speed value\n    return speed;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is just one example implementation and it may not be the most optimal or correct solution depending on the specifics of the problem domain.",
