At the end of each iteration, the `idx` variable is updated to indicate the next index in that dimension, and the `count` variable is updated to reflect the new progress made. \n\nAfter the loop exits, `count` should be set to the first index of the last dimension. Therefore, we increment it by 1 to start at the correct index in that dimension. Finally, `indices[last]` is set to the remaining distance from the starting index to the desired index in the last dimension.",
