Read the test code and any related documentation or comments to gain a better understanding.\n\n2. Reproduce the test failure locally. Run the failing test in isolation and use a debugger or logging statements to examine the behavior of the code before it fails. \n\n3. Once you have identified the root cause of the failure, modify the code to fix the bug. Depending on the issue, this may involve changing code within the test itself or modifying the implementation code that the test is calling. \n\n4. Run the test again to verify that the issue has been resolved. It may be necessary to repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to fully address the issue, as fixing one bug may reveal additional problems or issues in the code.",
