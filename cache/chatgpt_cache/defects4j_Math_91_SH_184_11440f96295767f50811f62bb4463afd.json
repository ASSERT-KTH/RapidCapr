                    "content": "Without more information about the Fraction class and the codebase, it is difficult to determine the exact fix for the compareTo method. However, one possible fix involves comparing the values of the fractions directly instead of converting them to doubles:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n    long dOn = object.numerator * (long)denominator;\n    return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\n\nThis fix computes the cross-product of the fractions (numerator1 * denominator2 and numerator2 * denominator1) directly as longs instead of converting to doubles. The Long.compare method is used to compare the fractions and return -1, 0, or +1 accordingly.\n\nIt is important to note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other fixes that are more appropriate depending on the implementation of the Fraction class and how it is used in the codebase.",
