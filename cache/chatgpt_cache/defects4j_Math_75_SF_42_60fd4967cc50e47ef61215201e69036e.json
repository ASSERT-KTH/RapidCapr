The original code snippet does not provide enough context to verify this, but I suspect that the `getCumPct` method is not properly handling `Integer` values.\n\nHere is a possible fix for the `getCumPct` method:\n```java\n    public double getCumPct(Comparable<?> v) {\n        int count = getCount(v);\n        int totalCount = getTotalCount();\n        int index = getIndex(v);\n        return ((double) index + (double) count / 2.0) / (double) totalCount;\n    }\n```\n\nThis fix involves casting the `count` variable to a `double` before performing the arithmetic operation, which ensures that the result is a floating point value. This should address any issues with integer division that could result in incorrect percentages.\n\nPlease let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further assistance.",

As it turns out, the error message indicates that the `getCumPct` method is already defined somewhere else in the codebase and cannot be redefined within the `Frequency` class.\n\nIn this case, you will need to modify the existing `getCumPct` method to fix the bug. Here is a possible fix for the method:\n```java\n    public double getCumPct(Comparable<?> v) {\n        int count = getCount(v);\n        int totalCount = getTotalCount();\n        if (totalCount == 0) {\n            return Double.NaN;\n        } else {\n            int index = getIndex(v);\n            return ((double) index + (double) count / 2.0) / (double) totalCount;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis fix includes an additional check to ensure that `totalCount` is not zero before attempting to calculate the percentage.
