As per the implementation, it returns `false` when `l` is less than or equal to 1 or when the length of `string` is divisible by a number between 2 and `l-1`.\n\nA possible fix for this issue could be to return `true` when the length of the input string is not divisible by any number between 2 and `l-1`. A correct hunk that implements this fix is:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 2; i < l; i += 1) {\n    if (l % i == 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\nreturn true;\n```\n\nThis way, the loop checks every number between 2 and `l-1` for being a factor of the input string length. If any of them is a factor, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.",
