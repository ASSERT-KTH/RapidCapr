                    "content": "Based on the current implementation and the test case provided, it seems that the issue is caused by passing the same value for `paint` and `outlinePaint` in the `super` constructor call. \nA potential fix could be to modify the constructor as follows:\n```java\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n    setOutlinePaint(outlinePaint != null ? outlinePaint : paint);\n    setOutlineStroke(outlineStroke);\n}\n```\nThis implementation uses `setOutlinePaint` to set the outline paint and `setOutlineStroke` to set the outline stroke. Note that we're passing `alpha` to the `super` constructor since this seems to be part of the `JFreeChart` library. \n\nFurthermore, we're using the ternary operator to set the outline paint to `outlinePaint` if it's not null, otherwise we fall back to the fill paint (`paint`). \n\nThis fix should handle cases where the outline paint needs to be different from the fill paint, while still maintaining the option of having them the same.",
