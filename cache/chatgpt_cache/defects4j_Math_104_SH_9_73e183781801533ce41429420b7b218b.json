Since there was no code provided initially, I assumed that the hunk would be inserted in an existing class. \n\nIf the removed hunk was:\n```java\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 10e-9;\n```\n\nThen to restore it, you need to check if it was part of a class or an interface or defined within a method. If it was inside a class, it should look like this:\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    // your class code here\n    \n    private static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 10e-9;\n}\n```\nIf it was defined within a method, it should look like this:\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    // your class code here\n    \n    public void myMethod() {\n        // your method code here\n        \n        double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 10e-9;\n        \n        // more code here\n    }\n}\n```\nI hope this helps.
