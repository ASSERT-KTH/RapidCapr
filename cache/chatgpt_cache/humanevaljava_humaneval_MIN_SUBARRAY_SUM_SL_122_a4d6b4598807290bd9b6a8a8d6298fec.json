Assuming that we want to find the sum of the smallest subarray in the list of numbers `nums`, the correct implementation would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static long min_subarray_sum(ArrayList<Long> nums) {\n    long min_sum = Long.MAX_VALUE;\n    long s = 0;\n    for(long num : nums) {\n        s += num;\n        min_sum = Math.min(min_sum, s);\n        s = Math.min(s, 0);\n    }\n    return min_sum;\n}\n```\n\nThe idea here is to keep track of the running sum `s` and the minimum subarray sum `min_sum` seen so far. We update `min_sum` with the running sum whenever the running sum becomes smaller, and then reset `s` to 0 (i.e., start a new potential subarray). We also update `s` to be the smaller of itself and 0, since any prefix of a negative subarray can be safely discarded.",
