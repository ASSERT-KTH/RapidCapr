This means that it may not find the largest divisor of `n` if that divisor is smaller than `n/2`.\n\nOne alternative fix hunk could be to check factors in increasing order from 1 to `n/2`, and keep track of the largest factor that divides `n`. The fixed code could look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static int largest_divisor(int n) {\n    int largest = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++) {\n        if (n % i == 0) {\n            largest = i;\n        }\n    }\n    return largest;\n}\n```\n\nThis should correctly find the largest divisor of `n`.",
