It means that the method would return true if the current element is equal to 0. \n- The alternative fix starts from `i + 1` to avoid checking the same pair twice and it also doesn't include the current element in the inner loop. \n- This alternative fix should provide the correct behavior of the `pairs_sum_to_zero` method by checking between all pairs that are not equal to 0.",
