More context about the class and the intended behavior is needed to provide an accurate fix.\n\nHowever, here is a possible fix hunk that could address the test failure:\n\n```java\n// Calculate the week of the year based on the provided date and time zone\nCalendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\ncalendar.setTime(time);\ncalendar.setTimeZone(zone);\nint weekOfYear = calendar.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);\n\n// Initialize the Week object with the calculated week of the year\nthis.week = weekOfYear;\n```\n\nThis code retrieves the current instance of the calendar with the provided time and time zone, calculates the week of the year based on the retrieved calendar, and initializes the Week object with the calculated week of the year. This assumes that the objective of the Week constructor is to initialize the `week` field of the Week object with the week of the year based on the provided arguments.\n\nHowever, without more context it's hard to determine if this solution addresses the original bug.",
