Instead of checking the product of the values at the endpoints of the range, we should check the signs of those values to determine whether there is a zero within that range.\n\nThe correct hunk to be inserted at the infill location is:\n```java\n            if (poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, center) < 0) {\n                end = center;\n            } else {\n                begin = center;\n            }\n``` \n\nThis should fix the problem and pass the failing test.",
