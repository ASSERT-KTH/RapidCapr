However, it ensures that the input character is converted to lowercase before performing the encryption operation. This is because the encryption only works for lowercase characters in the current implementation, and if an uppercase character is encountered, it will not be encrypted correctly. By converting the character to lowercase before encryption, this issue is now resolved.",
