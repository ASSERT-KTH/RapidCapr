However, based on the error message you're seeing, it looks like the symbol `getCumPct` is not defined or cannot be resolved in the current context.\n\nTo address this issue, you may need to check that you have the correct import statements for the class or interface that contains the `getCumPct` method. Alternatively, it may be necessary to define the `getCumPct` method in the same class where `getPct` is defined or in a superclass or interface that the class or interface containing `getPct` extends or implements.\n\nOnce the `getCumPct` method is properly defined and accessible in the current context, you can use the following hunk to fix the method:\n```\npublic <T extends Comparable<? super T>> double getPct(T v) {\n    return getCumPct(v);\n}\n``` \nThis should properly call the `getCumPct` method with a `Comparable` parameter and return the percentage value of the given input.",
