Here is an updated solution:\n\nAssuming that the function has not been provided, I will provide sample code that would help fix this error. I do not have access to the function implementation, so this is just a general solution.\n\nThe error `\"error: ';' expected\"` typically occurs when there is a missing semicolon in the code. To fix this error, you should check the code and add a semicolon where necessary. Here's an example fix that might help:\n\n```java\npublic void getProperty() {\n    String propName = \"myProperty\";\n    \n    String propValue = System.getProperty(propName);\n    \n    if(propValue != null) {\n        System.out.println(\"Property value: \" + propValue);\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"Property not found.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just a general solution and may not work for every scenario.
