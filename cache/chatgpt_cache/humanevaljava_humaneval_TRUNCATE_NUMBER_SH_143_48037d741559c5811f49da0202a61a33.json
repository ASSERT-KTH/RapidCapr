Given that the original implementation returned `number / 1.0` which is equivalent to `number`, I assume that the expected output of the failing test is `0.5` while the actual output is not matching due to precision. To fix this issue, we can use `Math.floor()` to remove the decimal points and then divide the number by 1.0 to convert it back to a double. The corrected implementation is as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static double truncate_number(double number) {\n    return Math.floor(number * 10.0) / 10.0;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation should fix the test failure while still truncating the number to one decimal point.",
