In its current state, the loop is missing a variable declaration for `j`, which is causing the test to fail.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to add the variable declaration for `j`. Since we want to compare each element with all the other elements that come after it in the array, we should start the inner loop at `i + 1`. This ensures that each element is compared exactly once with all the elements that come after it.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix hunk is option number 5.",
