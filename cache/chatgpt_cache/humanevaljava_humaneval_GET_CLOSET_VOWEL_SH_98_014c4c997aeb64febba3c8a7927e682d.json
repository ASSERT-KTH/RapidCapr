By returning inside the loop as soon as a vowel is found, we are not checking the rest of the word for a potentially closer vowel. \n\nTo fix this, we should store the closest vowel found so far outside the loop and return it at the end. Here is the corrected hunk:\n```java\n        int closest_vowel_index = -1;\n        int distance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {\n            if(vowels.contains(word.charAt(i))) {\n                int curr_distance = Math.min(i, word.length() - i - 1);\n                if(curr_distance < distance) {\n                    distance = curr_distance;\n                    closest_vowel_index = i;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return closest_vowel_index >= 0 ? word.substring(closest_vowel_index, closest_vowel_index + 1) : \"\";\n```\nI hope this solves the problem.",
