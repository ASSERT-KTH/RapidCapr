However, it uses `s.indexOf((int) c)`, which is not always valid and can cause an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The alternative fix hunk uses `d.indexOf(c)` which correctly retrieves the index of the current character. It also adds 2 to the index and then takes the result mod 26 to ensure that the resulting index remains within the bounds of the `d` string. This calculates the encrypted character by looking ahead two positions.",
