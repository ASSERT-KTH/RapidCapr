The correct condition to check for prime length is if the length is divisible only by 1 and itself, and this can be checked by iterating from 2 to `l - 1` and checking the remainder of the division of `l` by the current iteration index. If the remainder is zero for any iteration index, then it is not a prime length and the function returns false, otherwise, it returns true.",
