                    "content": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the `compareTo` method compares two instances of the `Fraction` class. The original buggy hunk used the `doubleValue` method to obtain the double values of the fractions, which is incorrect.\n\nTo compare two fractions, we need to find their common denominator and compare the numerators. Therefore, we need to replace the removed hunk with code that computes the common denominator and converts the numerators to a common scale. Here's a correct fix:\n\n```java\n// Compute the common denominator\nlong commonDenominator = lcm(denominator, object.denominator);\n\n// Convert the numerators to a common scale\nlong nOd = numerator * (commonDenominator / denominator);\nlong dOn = object.numerator * (commonDenominator / object.denominator);\n\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n```\n\nThe `lcm` method computes the least common multiple of two numbers, which can be defined as:\n\n```java\npublic static long lcm(long a, long b) {\n    return (a / gcd(a, b)) * b;\n}\n\npublic static long gcd(long a, long b) {\n    while (b != 0) {\n        long temp = b;\n        b = a % b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return a;\n}\n```\n\nThis fix computes the common denominator as the least common multiple of the two denominators, and then converts the numerators to a common scale by multiplying them by the factor `commonDenominator / denominator` or `commonDenominator / object.denominator`.",
