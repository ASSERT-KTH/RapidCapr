However, here is a possible fix hunk that could resolve the issue:\n\n```java\n        } else {\n          if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n \n              && !parent.getParent().isCall()) {\n            recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        } else {\n            recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);\n        }\n      }\n```\n\nThis fix hunk checks if the parent of the assignment is not a call and the current node is not the second child of the parent (which implies that it is inside the `for` loop condition or update) before recording the dependency scope. If both conditions are met, the dependency scope is recorded using the `recordNode`, otherwise it is recorded using the `nameNode`. This fix hunk retains the original logic of the code while addressing the potential issue of incorrect reference edges between referenced and assigned variables. \n\nHowever, please note that this fix hunk is based on assumptions, and it may not be the most appropriate solution for the specific bug. The best solution would require more context and a deeper understanding of the code and the problem.",
