Checking whether both endpoints of the search interval have absolute values greater than the convergence to ensure that the root-finding method is appropriate.\n\n2. Swapping the roles of `ta` and `tb` if the magnitude of the function value at `ta` is smaller than that at `tb`. This helps to ensure that the function values at the endpoints have different signs.\n\nI hope this implementation will work correctly.",
