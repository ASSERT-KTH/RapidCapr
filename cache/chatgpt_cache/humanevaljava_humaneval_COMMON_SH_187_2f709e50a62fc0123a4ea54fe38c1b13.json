This caused the test to fail because the `ArrayList` did not eliminate duplicates, resulting in a wrong array length and wrong element values.\n\nThe alternative fix 2 uses a `HashSet` to store common elements, which automatically eliminates duplicates. Another alternative fix would be to keep using an `ArrayList` but add a condition to check if an element is already present before adding it to the list. However, using a `HashSet` is more concise and efficient. Alternatively, we can use a `List` here but need to ensure that the duplicates are eliminated before generating a new array.",
