To fix this issue, we can return an unmodifiable list or collection's iterator.\n\nHere is an alternative fix hunk that is based on the 4th option:\n```java\nreturn Collections.unmodifiableCollection(chromosomes).iterator();\n```\nThis hunk returns an iterator of an unmodifiable collection, which will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if any attempt is made to remove elements from it.\n\nPlease note that there are other possible fixes as well, such as using an enhanced for-loop to iterate over the chromosome or cloning the original collection before returning its iterator. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine which solution is the most appropriate.",
