One possible fix is to check if the type variable has bounds before trying to extract the actual type argument. Here is a suggested fix:\n\n```java\nprivate void readTypeVariables() {\n    for (Type type : typeVariable.getBounds()) {\n        registerTypeVariablesOn(type);\n    }\n    if (typeVariable.getBounds().length > 0) {\n        registerTypeVariablesOn(getActualTypeArgumentFor(typeVariable));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis fix checks if the type variable has bounds before trying to extract the actual type argument, and only does so if there are bounds. This should prevent the `MockitoException` caused by trying to perform a raw extraction on a type variable with no bounds.",
