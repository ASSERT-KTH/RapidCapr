However, more context about the `work` array and its use in the rest of the code would be necessary to provide a more definitive answer.\n\nAs an alternative fix line, you may try the following:\n```java\nint j = 4 * n - pingPong - 1;\n``` \nThis computes `j` as if the buggy line were `int j = 4 * n - 1 - pingPong;` and adjusts it to account for the fact that the `for` loop increments `j` by `-4` each iteration (i.e., `j` is actually the index of the last element to be swapped).",
