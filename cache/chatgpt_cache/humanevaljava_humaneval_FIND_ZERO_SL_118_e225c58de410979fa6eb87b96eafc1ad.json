If they have same sign, it means `center` should be the new value of `begin`, otherwise `center` should be the new value of `end`.\n- In fix line 2, the condition is changed to check if the sign of `poly(xs, center)` and `poly(xs, end)` is opposite or not. If they have opposite sign, jump to the next iteration by updating the value of `begin` with `center`, otherwise update the value of `end` with `center`.",
