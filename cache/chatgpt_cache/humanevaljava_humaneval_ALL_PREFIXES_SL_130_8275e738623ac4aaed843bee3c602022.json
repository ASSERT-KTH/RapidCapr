The substring method takes two parameters: the beginning index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive). By using `substring(0, i+1)`, we are including all characters up to and including the current character at index `i` to generate the prefix.\n2. This fix uses `substring(0, i)` instead, which includes all characters up to but not including the current character at index `i`. This generates the correct prefix for the test case mentioned in the description.",
