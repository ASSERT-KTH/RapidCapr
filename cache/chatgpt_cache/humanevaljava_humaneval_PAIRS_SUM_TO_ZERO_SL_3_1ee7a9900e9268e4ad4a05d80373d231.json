The first fix starts the inner loop from `i + 1` to avoid checking pairs that have already been checked and the second fix starts the inner loop from `i` to check all possible pairs. Which one to use depends on whether duplicates are allowed in the input list. If duplicates are allowed, the second fix should be used because it checks all possible pairs.
