Thank you for pointing that out. \n\nIt seems that the issue with the original test failure is that the `hex_key()` function is counting the number of characters in the input string rather than counting the number of characters that are hexadecimal digits. To fix this issue, we need to update the `if` statement in the buggy line to check for hexadecimal digits instead of specific characters (`2`, `3`, `5`, `7`). \n\nWe can do this by using the `Character` class's `isDigit()` and `isLetter()` methods to check if the character is a hexadecimal digit. Here is the fixed `hex_key()` function with the updated `if` statement:\n\n```java\npublic static int hex_key(String num) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (char c : num.toCharArray()) {\n        if (Character.isDigit(c) || (Character.isLetter(c) && \"abcdef\".indexOf(Character.toLowerCase(c)) != -1)) {\n            result += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis should fix the original test failure.",
