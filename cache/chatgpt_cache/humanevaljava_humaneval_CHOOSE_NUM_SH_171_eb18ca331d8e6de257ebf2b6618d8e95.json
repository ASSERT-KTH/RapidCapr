Instead of returning -1 when x is less than y, it returns -1 when x is equal to y. This is because the test case is failing when the function is called with values x=10 and y=14, where y is even. The original code returns y (which is 14), but the expected output from the test case is -1. In this case, x is not less than y, but it is equal to y. Therefore, the code should return -1 instead of y.",
