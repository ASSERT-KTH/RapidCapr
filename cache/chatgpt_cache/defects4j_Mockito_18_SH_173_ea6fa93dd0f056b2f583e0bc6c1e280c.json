You can resolve the issue by replacing the buggy code with the following code at the infill location:\n\n```java\nreturn Objects.equals(StringDescription.toString(m), Objects.toString(arg, null));\n```\n\nThis code uses the `Objects` class to check if the argument is null. The `toString()` method returns the string representation of the argument or `\"null\"` if the argument is `null`. The `Objects.equals()` method compares the two strings and returns `true` if they are equal or `false` otherwise.",
