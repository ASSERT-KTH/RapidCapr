I can see now that my previous solution does not resolve the issue at hand.\n\nUpon further inspection, the issue seems to be with the adding of 2 to vowels in the original code. It should only add 2 to characters that are not vowels.\n\nTherefore, the correct hunk for the buggy code is:\n\n```java\nif (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {\n    c = Character.toLowerCase(c);\n} else if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {\n    if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u') {\n        c = (char) ((int) c + 2);\n    }\n    c = Character.toUpperCase(c);\n}\n```\n\nThis will handle the case of toggling the case of the character if it is a letter, and also check if the character is a consonant before adding 2 to it.\n\nI hope this solves the issue.",
