For example, if there are any nested loops or recursive calls that can be optimized.\n\n2. Consider increasing the timeout value for the test if possible. If you are using a testing framework such as JUnit, you can often adjust the timeout value for individual tests or for the entire test suite.\n\n3. If the computation is inherently complex or simply takes too long to execute, consider using caching mechanisms or other performance optimizations to speed up the execution time.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your specific code and test case, and I will do my best to assist you further.",

Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider optimizing your code for performance. Look for ways to make your code more efficient by reducing the number of iterations or improving your algorithms.\n2. Check for infinite loops or extremely long iteration times in your code. Sometimes, small mistakes in your code can cause it to run indefinitely or take much longer than expected to complete. \n3. Consider splitting your code into smaller, more manageable functions. This can help make your code easier to understand and debug, and can also help you isolate performance issues to specific sections of your code.\n4.
