                    "content": "Based on the provided code and test case, it seems that the issue occurs when an assignment expression with a call expression on the right-hand side is encountered. The original buggy code did not correctly handle such cases.\n\nHere is an alternative fix hunk that should resolve the issue:\n\n```java\nif (ns != null) {\n  // Check if the parent of the node is a call expression.\n  // If so, do not associate the right-hand side with the dependency scope.\n  // This is because the right-hand side is actually a callee, not a reference.\n  if (!NodeUtil.isParentCall(parent)) {\n    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n      // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n      // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.\n      // ...\n    } else {\n      recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code first checks if the parent of the node is a call expression. If it is, then it skips the current assignment node and assumes that the right-hand side of the assignment is a callee, not a reference.\n\nIf the parent is not a call expression, this alternative hunk updates the same logic from the original code for handling assignments within `for` loops.\n\nI hope this helps to resolve the issue!",
