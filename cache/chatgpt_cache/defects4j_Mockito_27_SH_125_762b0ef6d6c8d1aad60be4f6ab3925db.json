It seems that there is a deeper issue in the code that cannot be fixed by simply adding a missing hunk.\n\nThe original test failure might be caused by a problem in the `MethodInterceptorFilter` class or in the `MockHandler` class that is used by it. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue without more information about the code and the test.\n\nIn general, the `AssertionFailedError` that is thrown by the `listener` test indicates that the behavior of the code under test does not match the expected behavior. This could be due to a problem in the test itself or in the code that it is testing.\n\nTo address the issue, you may need to perform further debugging and analysis of the code and the test. You can also try simplifying the test, breaking it down into smaller parts to identify the source of the problem.",
