Here's a possible fix for the missing hunk:\n\n```java\n    public static int fib(int n) {\n        if (n <= 1) {\n            return n;\n        }\n        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);\n    }\n```\n\nThe added hunk checks if `n` is less than or equal to `1`, and returns `n` if it is. This provides a base case for the recursive calls in the method, preventing it from going into an infinite loop.",
