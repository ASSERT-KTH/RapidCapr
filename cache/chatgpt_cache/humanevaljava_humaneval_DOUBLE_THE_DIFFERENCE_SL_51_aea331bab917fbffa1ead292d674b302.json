Here is another suggestion for the infill line:\n\n```java\n    result += (int) (2 * (d - Math.floor(d)));\n```\n\nThe reason for this change is that the original code was checking if `d_int` (the integer value of the input element) was odd and greater than or equal to 0, but the test case is checking for the sum of all positive odd values that have a fractional part in the input array. \n\nThe new fix achieves this by calculating the fractional part of `d` and multiplying it by two, then casting the result to an integer and adding it to the `result` variable. This ensures that only the positive odd values in the input array are summed. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any further issues!",
