Therefore, the correct line at the infill location would be to add a semicolon at the end of the line where `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` is used:\n\n```java\n    public static boolean iscude(int a) {\n        double root = Math.pow(a, 1./3);\n        BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(root);\n        int round_root = (int) bd.setScale(0, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();\n\n        return ((int) Math.pow(round_root, 3)) == a;\n>>>    ; <<<\n    }\n``` \n\nWith this change, the code should compile successfully.",
