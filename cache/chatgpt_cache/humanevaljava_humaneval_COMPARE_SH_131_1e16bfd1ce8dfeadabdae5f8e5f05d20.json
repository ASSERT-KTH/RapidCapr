Thank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nIn that case, it seems like the problem lies with the original buggy hunk provided. Assuming that the current implementation is correct for the given use case of `compare` method, here's a possible fix for the failed test case:\n\n```java\n    public static int[] compare(int[] game, int[] guess) {\n        int[] result = new int[game.length];\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < game.length; i += 1) {\n            if (guess[i] == 0) {\n                result[i] = -1;\n            } else if (game[i] == guess[i]) {\n                result[i] = 1;\n            } else if (game[i] % guess[i] == 0) {\n                result[i] = Math.floorDiv(game[i], guess[i]);\n            } else {\n                result[i] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n```\n\nThis implementation adds conditions to handle two additional cases: (i) when `guess[i]` is 0, and (ii) when `game[i] % guess[i] != 0`. Depending on your use case, you may need to modify these cases or add additional ones.\n\nI hope this helps in resolving the issue. Please let me know if you have any further concerns.",
