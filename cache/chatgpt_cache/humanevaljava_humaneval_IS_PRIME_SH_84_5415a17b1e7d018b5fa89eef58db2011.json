Also, we loop till `sqrt(n)` because if `n` has a factor `k` that is greater than its square root, then it must have a corresponding factor that is less than its square root (due to the fact that factors always come in pairs). Also, we increment `k` by 1 in each iteration instead of the buggy code's increment of `k` by 1. Finally, for each `k`, we add an if-statement that returns `false` if `n` is divisible by `k`.",
