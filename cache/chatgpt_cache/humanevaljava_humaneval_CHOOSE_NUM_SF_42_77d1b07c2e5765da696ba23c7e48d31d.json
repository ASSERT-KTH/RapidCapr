Based on the original test failure, there seems to be an issue with the `choose_num()` function when `x` and `y` are close in value and `y` is odd.\n\nAfter analyzing the function further, it seems that the `y == x + 1` condition is not handled properly. Here's a corrected version of the `choose_num()` function that should pass all the tests, including the original failed test:\n\n```java\npublic static int choose_num(int x, int y) {\n    if (x <= y) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    if (y % 2 == 0) {\n        return y;\n    } else {\n        if (y == x + 1) {\n            return -1;\n        } else {\n            return y - 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith this updated code, the original test case and all other tests should pass successfully.",
