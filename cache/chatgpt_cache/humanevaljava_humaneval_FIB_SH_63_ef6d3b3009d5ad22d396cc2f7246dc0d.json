One possible fix is to use an iterative approach instead of a recursive one to avoid the performance issues caused by multiple function calls.\n\nHere's a possible fix hunk:\n```java\n    public static int fib(int n) {\n        if (n < 0) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"n must be non-negative\");\n        }\n        if (n <= 1) {\n            return n;\n        }\n        int prev1 = 0;\n        int prev2 = 1;\n        int current = 0;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            current = prev1 + prev2;\n            prev1 = prev2;\n            prev2 = current;\n        }\n        return current;\n    }\n```\nThis fix checks for negative values of `n` and throws an exception if necessary. Then it uses an iterative approach to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number. It initializes the previous two numbers to 0 and 1, respectively, and iterates through the remaining numbers until it reaches `n`. At each iteration, it calculates the current number as the sum of the previous two numbers and updates the previous two numbers accordingly. Finally, it returns the calculated `n`th Fibonacci number.",
