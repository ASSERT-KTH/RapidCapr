Based on the original buggy hunk and the failing test case, it seems that the intended behavior of the `truncate_number` method is to truncate any decimal places after the second decimal point. Here's a correct hunk that should fix the issue:\n\n```java\npublic static double truncate_number(double number) {\n   return Math.floor(number * 100) / 100.0;\n}\n``` \n\nThis solution multiplies the number by 100, rounds it down to the nearest integer (which effectively removes any decimal places beyond two), and then divides by 100 to get the original number truncated to two decimal places. This should pass the failing test case, `test_0`.",
