This is incorrect because the loop should iterate from 2 to `n`.\n- In the original code, the if-statement inside the loop is also incorrect. It is assigning `i/2 - 1` to the even indices of the sequence, which doesn't produce the correct sequence. Instead, we should be assigning the value of `sequence[i/2]` to the even indices.\n- The else block in the original code is updating the sequence using an incorrect formula. I have changed it to the correct formula for calculating the Triangular sequence.",
