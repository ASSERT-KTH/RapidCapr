The correct infill line for the first code snippet should be:\n\n```java\nreturn x + y;\n```\n\nAs for the second code snippet, it seems like the method name is misspelled - it should be `isCube` instead of `iscude`. Also, the `RoundingMode` enum needs to be imported. Here is the fixed code:\n\n```java\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\nimport java.math.RoundingMode;\n\npublic static boolean isCube(int a) {\n    double root = Math.pow(a, 1./3);\n    BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(root);\n    int round_root = (int) bd.setScale(0, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();\n\n    return ((int) Math.pow(round_root, 3)) == a;\n}\n```\n\nI hope this resolves the issue.",
