Since we want to find 3 numbers `A[i], A[j], A[k]` that add up to a number divisible by 3, we can loop through the indices in the array and check all combinations of 3 numbers. Therefore, the correct hunk could be:\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < n-2; i += 1) {\n    for (int j = i+1; j < n-1; j += 1) {\n        for (int k = j+1; k < n; k += 1) {\n            if ((A[i] + A[j] + A[k]) % 3 == 0) {\n                result += 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n``` \nThis will ensure that we are checking all combinations of 3 numbers, and the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are starting from the correct indices, i.e., `i < j < k`.",
