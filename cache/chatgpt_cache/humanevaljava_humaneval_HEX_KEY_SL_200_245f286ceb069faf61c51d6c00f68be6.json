To fix the issue, we need to modify the `hex_key` method to check if the character is a valid hexadecimal character before incrementing the result. We can do this using the `Character.isDigit()` and `Character.toLowerCase()` methods as shown in the corrected code below:\n\n```java\npublic static int hex_key(String num) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (char c : num.toLowerCase().toCharArray()) {\n        if (Character.isDigit(c) || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'f')) {\n            result += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis code should fix the issue and pass the failing test case.",
