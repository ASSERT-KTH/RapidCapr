                    "content": "Based on the information provided, it seems like the function `total_match` is supposed to return a list containing all the common elements in `lst1` and `lst2`, but the current implementation is incorrect and incomplete. Therefore, in order to provide the correct hunk at the infill location and fix the test failure, I propose the following alternative fix:\n\n```java\npublic static List<String> total_match(List<String> lst1, List<String> lst2) {\n    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    for (String st : lst1) {\n        if (lst2.contains(st)) {\n            result.add(st);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates over all the elements in `lst1` and checks if each element is also present in `lst2`. If an element is common to both lists, it is added to the `result` list. Finally, the `result` list is returned, which should contain all the common elements in both `lst1` and `lst2`.\n\nThis alternative fix does not require the calculation of the lengths of the lists, and it should correctly pass the failing test case by returning the expected list `\"[hi, hi, admin, project]\"`.",
