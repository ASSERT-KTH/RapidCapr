The correct approach would be to only initialize the first three numbers 0, 0, and 2, respectively, and then calculate the rest of the Fibonacci sequence using the previous four numbers in the list. However, the list should never exceed a size of 4 to avoid memory overload, hence the need to remove the first element of the array after each calculation and add the latest Fibonacci number to the end of the list.",

The correct approach is to always calculate the sum of the previous four numbers in the list and store it as the latest Fibonacci number. Since we only need to keep the previous four numbers, we remove the first element of the array after each calculation and add the latest Fibonacci number to the end of the list as before.",
