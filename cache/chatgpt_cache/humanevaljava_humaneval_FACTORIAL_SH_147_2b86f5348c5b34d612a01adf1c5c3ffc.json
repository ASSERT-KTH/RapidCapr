So, we should replace the code with the updated hunk that initializes `x` to `1`. We noticed that the factorial of any odd number is zero and the original hunk tries to calculate factorial of an odd number which introduces an error. Therefore, we have changed the code in the infill location to calculate the factorial of the even numbers only. The updated hunk calculates the factorial of the current integer `i` and stores it in the list `ret`.",
