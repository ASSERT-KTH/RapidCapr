The issue may be with the fact that the original buggy line was only calculating the product of the units digit of `a` and `b`. A possible fix would be to use a loop to multiply the digits of `a` with the digits of `b` for each place. One such implementation could be:\n```java\npublic static int multiply(int a, int b) {\n    int result = 0;\n    int digit = 0;\n    while (b != 0) {\n        int temp = a;\n        temp *= (b%10);\n        temp *= Math.pow(10, digit);\n        result += temp; \n        digit++;\n        b /= 10;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n``` \nThis implementation will iterate through each digit in `b` and multiply it with the integer value of `a`. It will then add the product to `result` after shifting it by the correct place value. The loop will continue until all digits in `b` have been multiplied.",
