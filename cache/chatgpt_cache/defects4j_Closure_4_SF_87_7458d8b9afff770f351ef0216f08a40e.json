Here is another attempt to fix the issue.\n\nThe issue is that, in some cases, `resolved` is `true` even when the type has not been resolved by the `registry`. This can be fixed by checking if `getReferencedType()` is null after calling `resolveViaRegistry()`. Another issue is that, if the type was resolved via the `registry`, we still need to call `super.resolveInternal(...)` since this performs additional tasks that are necessary for the type to behave correctly.\n\n```java\n  JSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter reporter, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n    boolean resolved = registry != null && resolveViaRegistry(reporter, enclosing);\n    if (!resolved) {\n      resolveViaProperties(reporter, enclosing);\n      if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {\n        handleTypeCycle(reporter);\n      }\n    }\n    if (isResolved()) {\n      finishPropertyContinuations();\n      super.resolveInternal(reporter, enclosing);\n    }\n    return registry != null && registry.isLastGeneration() ?\n        getReferencedType() :\n        this;\n  }\n```\n\nWith this fix, we correctly check if the type was resolved by the `registry` and call `super.resolveInternal(...)` if needed.
