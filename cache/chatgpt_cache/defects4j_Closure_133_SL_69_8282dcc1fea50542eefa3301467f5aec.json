Given the error message, it seems the following line is the issue rather than the infill location:\n\n```java\n    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n```\n\nThere may be an issue with `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine()` which returns `null`. To fix this, you can try changing the method to:\n\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n    return (result == null) ? \"\" : result.trim();\n}\n```\n\nThis is assuming that an empty string is an acceptable return in case `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine()` returns null. Please let me know if this resolves the issue.",
