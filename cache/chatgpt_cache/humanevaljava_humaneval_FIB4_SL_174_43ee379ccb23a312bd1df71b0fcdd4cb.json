The modified version can have its memory footprint optimized by removing the first element of the `ArrayList` after storing it in the variable `sum` and adding `sum` to the end of the `ArrayList`. This ensures that the size of the `ArrayList` is limited to the last four terms of the modified Fibonacci sequence.",
