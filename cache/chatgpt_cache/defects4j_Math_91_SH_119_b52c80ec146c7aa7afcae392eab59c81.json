                    "content": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the original buggy hunk (which has been removed) calculated `nOd` and `dOn` as doubles using the `doubleValue()` method, but this caused the code to fail on the `testCompareTo` test.\n\nTo generate an alternative fix, we need to calculate `nOd` and `dOn` correctly so that the `compareTo` method returns the expected result for the `testCompareTo` test.\n\nOne possible solution is to calculate `nOd` as the product of the numerator of `this` fraction and the denominator of `object` fraction, and calculate `dOn` as the product of the denominator of `this` fraction and the numerator of `object` fraction, using long arithmetic to avoid overflow. This solution ensures that `nOd` and `dOn` are calculated correctly and with sufficient precision, so that the `compareTo` method can correctly determine the ordering of the two fractions.\n\nHere is the corrected hunk:\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = (long)this.denominator * object.numerator;\n        return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n    }\n```\nThis hunk calculates `nOd` and `dOn` as longs, and then compares them to determine the ordering of the two fractions.\n\nPlease note that this fix assumes that the `numerator` and `denominator` fields of the `Fraction` class are both integers. If this is not the case, the fix may need to be modified accordingly.",
