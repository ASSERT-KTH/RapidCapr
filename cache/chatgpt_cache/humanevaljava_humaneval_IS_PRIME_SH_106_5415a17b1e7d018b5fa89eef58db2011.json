To fix this, we need to change the condition in the for loop to ensure it terminates after checking all possible divisors up to the square root of n. Here are some possible fix hunks:\n1. ```java\nfor (int k = 2; k <= Math.sqrt(n); k++) {\n```\n2. ```java\nfor (int k = 2; k <= n/2; k++) {\n```\n3. ```java\nfor (int k = 2; k*k <= n; k++) {\n```\n\nNote that the third option uses the fact that if n is not a prime number, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. Thus, we only need to check values of k up to the square root of n. \n\nPlease choose one of these fix hunks for the infill location.",
