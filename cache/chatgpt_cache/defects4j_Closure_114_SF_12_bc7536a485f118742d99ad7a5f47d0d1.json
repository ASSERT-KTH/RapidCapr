If it is an assignment operation, we need to further check if the current assignment is on the `rhs` of the operation. The fix is to add an additional condition to check if the current assignment is on the `rhs` of the operation before recording the `dependency scope`.",

Here's the corrected code:\n\n```java\n  private void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n    Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();\n    Node parent = n.getParent();\n    NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);\n    if (ns != null) {\n      if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n        if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n) {\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        } else {\n          recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);\n        }\n      } else if (NodeUtil.isAssignmentOp(parent)) {\n        if (parent.getFirstChild() == n) {\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        }\n      } else {\n        recordDepScope(n, ns);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe issue is similar to the previous one - the function only considers assignments of the form `lhs = rhs`. However, there are other forms of assignment, such as `lhs += rhs`, that are not being handled by the function. The solution is to use the `NodeUtil.isAssignmentOp` function to determine if the current assignment is an assignment operation or not.",
