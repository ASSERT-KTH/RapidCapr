In the original code, the `super` constructor was called with the arguments `paint`, `stroke`, `paint`, `stroke`, and `alpha`, which can be interpreted as (1) paint and stroke for the interior of the marker, and (2) paint and stroke for the border or outline of the marker. However, the expected test result indicates that the outline paint should be blue, which means the `outlinePaint` argument was not correctly passed to the `super` constructor.\n\nThe fix hunk resolves this issue by passing the correct `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` arguments to the `super` constructor, which would then correctly set the outline paint and stroke. Additionally, the `setOutlinePaint` and `setOutlineStroke` methods are called to ensure that the outline paint and stroke are correctly set. Finally, the `value` parameter is assigned to the instance variable `this.value`.",
