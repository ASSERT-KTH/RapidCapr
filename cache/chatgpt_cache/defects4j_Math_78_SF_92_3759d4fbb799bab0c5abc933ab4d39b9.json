With this change, the solver will find a root between `ta` and `tb`, even if the event lies beyond the next time step. Additionally, the `BrentSolver` is parameterized with a tolerance `eps`, which should be set to a value less than machine epsilon. This ensures that the solver will fail if it cannot find a root accurately enough, preventing cases where it returns a wrong or inaccurate root as a result of numerical issues.",
