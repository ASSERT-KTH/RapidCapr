One possible correct line could be:\n\n```java\nresult.add(s_list);\n```\n\nThis line would add the entire `s_list` String to the `result` ArrayList, which should contain all the words separated by spaces. However, this would only work if the input String `s` already contains the words separated by commas.\n\nAlternatively, we could replace the original empty line with:\n\n```java\nresult = Arrays.asList(s.split(\",\\\\s*\"));\n```\n\nThis line would split the input String `s` at each comma followed by zero or more spaces, and store the resulting words in an `ArrayList` using the `Arrays.asList()` method. This would eliminate the need for the for loop and the `s_list` variable.",
