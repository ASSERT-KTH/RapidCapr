However, based on the timeout error you mentioned, it seems like there may be some performance issues in the code.\n\nHere are a few tips that may help you resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursive calls that can cause the program to hang indefinitely.\n\n2. Optimize the code for better performance. This can include using more efficient algorithms or data structures, avoiding redundant calculations, and minimizing the number of function calls.\n\n3. Use parallel processing or multithreading to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and improve performance.\n\n4. Consider using a profiling tool to analyze the program's performance and identify any bottlenecks that may be causing the timeout error.\n\nIf you're still having trouble after trying these tips, please provide me the code for further analysis.",
