                    "content": "Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is with the `ValueMarker` constructor not correctly setting the outline paint. There are several possible fixes that could address this issue. Here is one example fix:\n\n```java\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint fillPaint, Stroke fillStroke,\n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(fillPaint, fillStroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n    setOutlinePaint(outlinePaint != null ? outlinePaint : fillPaint);\n    setOutlineStroke(outlineStroke != null ? outlineStroke : fillStroke);\n}\n```\n\nThis constructor uses the `super` constructor to set the fill paint, stroke, and alpha values first. It then sets the `value` field to the provided `value`. Finally, it sets the outline paint and stroke using the provided values, or defaults to the fill paint and stroke if the provided values are `null`.\n\nNote that this is just one example fix and there may be other solutions that would also work.",
