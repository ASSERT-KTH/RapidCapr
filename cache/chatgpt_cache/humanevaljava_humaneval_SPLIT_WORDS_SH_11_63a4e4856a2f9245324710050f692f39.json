I apologize for the mistake.\n\nIt appears that the issue is actually with the last return statement in the `split_words` method. It is currently returning a string array with only one element, which is the count of uppercase letters satisfying the condition. Instead, it should be returning an array of the words in `txt`.\n\nTo fix this, the last return statement can be replaced with the following code:\n\n```java\nString[] result = txt.split(\"[, ]+\");\nreturn result;\n```\n\nThis will split `txt` on commas and spaces and return an array of the resulting words.",
