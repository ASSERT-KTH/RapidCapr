Therefore, an alternative fix for the buggy hunk could be to replace the implementation of the gcd function with a correct one. One such implementation is the Euclidean algorithm, which can be implemented as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static int gcd(int u, int v) {\n    if (u == 0) {\n        return Math.abs(v);\n    }\n    if (v == 0) {\n        return Math.abs(u);\n    }\n    u = Math.abs(u);\n    v = Math.abs(v);\n    int r;\n    while (v != 0) {\n        r = u % v;\n        u = v;\n        v = r;\n    }\n    return u;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation works correctly for the failing test case and various other test cases, and does not need the condition in the if statement or any other modifications to the original code.",
