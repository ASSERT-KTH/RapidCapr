It seems that I missed the fact that the expected result in test_1 is based on the sum of the digits in the input string, not the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase letters. Here's an updated function that should address this:\n\n```java\npublic static int digit_sum(String s) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {\n        if (c == ' ') {\n            continue;\n        }\n        if ('0' <= c && c <= '9') {      // check for a digit\n            result += Character.getNumericValue(c);\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we check if the character is a digit using the condition `if ('0' <= c && c <= '9')` and add its numeric value to the `result` variable.\n\nI hope this helps!
