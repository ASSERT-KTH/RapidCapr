However, the `NullPointerException` error message suggests that there may be a null object reference somewhere in the code. Here are some general suggestions for how to debug and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for null objects: Go through the code and make sure that all objects are initialized before being used. If an object is null, either initialize it or add a check to handle the null value.\n\n2. Use null checks: Add null checks and guards to ensure that null values are handled properly. For example, use an if statement to check if a value is null before trying to use it.\n\n3. Use try/catch statements: Use try/catch statements to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully. This can prevent the program from crashing due to a null pointer exception.\n\n4. Debug the code: Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the source of the null pointer exception. Once you have identified the source, you can then fix the issue by either initializing the null object or adding a null check.\n\nWithout more information on the code and context of the issue, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution for the removed hunk.",
