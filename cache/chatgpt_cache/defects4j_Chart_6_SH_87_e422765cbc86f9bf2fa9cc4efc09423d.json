Here's a new suggestion:\n\nBased on the test failure you provided, it appears that the issue lies in the escaping of the `toolTipText` parameter in the `generateToolTipFragment` method. We can fix this by properly escaping the input string using the `htmlEscape` method provided by the `ImageMapUtilities` class in JFreeChart.\n\nThus, the correct hunk to fix the `generateToolTipFragment` method should be:\n```java\n    public String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n        return \" title=\\\"\" + ImageMapUtilities.htmlEscape(toolTipText) + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n    }\n```\n\nThis should correctly escape the input string and fix the failing test.",
