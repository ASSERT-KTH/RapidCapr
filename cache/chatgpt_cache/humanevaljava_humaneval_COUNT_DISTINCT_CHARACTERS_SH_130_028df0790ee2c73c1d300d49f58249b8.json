The current code checks if a character is already present in the set of distinct characters by using the `contains` method of the `HashSet`. However, it does not add the character to the set if it is not present, which is causing the count of distinct characters to be lower than expected.\n\nTo fix this, the infill location should add the current character to the set of distinct characters when it is not already present, regardless of its case. To achieve this, we can use `Character.toLowerCase` method to convert the character to lowercase and then add it to the set.\n\nHere is the fixed hunk:\n```java\ndistinct.add(Character.toLowerCase(c));\n``` \n\nThis should correctly count the distinct characters in the input string and pass the failing test case.",
