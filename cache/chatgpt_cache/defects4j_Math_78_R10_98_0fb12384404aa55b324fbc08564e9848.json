The `isBracketing` method checks if the root is within the original interval or close to the endpoints, which ensures that the root is bracketed and won't result in a `FunctionEvaluationException`.\n\nI hope this corrected version of the `evaluateStep` method resolves the test failure and works correctly for all cases.
