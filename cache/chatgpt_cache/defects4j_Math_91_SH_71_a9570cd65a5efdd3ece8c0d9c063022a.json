                    "content": "Based on the error message, it seems that the current implementation of `compareTo` is returning `0` instead of the expected `-1`. This suggests that the comparison is not implemented correctly and is not returning a negative value when the current object is less than the object being compared to.\n\nOne way to fix the comparison is to compare the fractions' numerators and denominators directly, rather than converting them to doubles. This can be achieved by multiplying the current object's numerator by the other object's denominator and comparing the result to the other object's numerator multiplied by the current object's denominator.\n\nThe correct hunk is:\n```java\nlong nOd = (long) numerator * object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long) denominator * object.numerator;\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n```\nThis implementation avoids the imprecision issues that arise from converting fractions to doubles and should correctly compare two fractions.",
