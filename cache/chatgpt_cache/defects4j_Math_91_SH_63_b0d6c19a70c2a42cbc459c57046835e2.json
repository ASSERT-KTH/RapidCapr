One possible way to fix it is to compare the cross products of the fractions' numerators and denominators, since the cross product represents the value of each fraction on a common denominator. \n\nTherefore, the correct hunk to replace `>>> [ INFILL ] <<<` is:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long)denominator * object.numerator;\n\nreturn Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n```\n\nThis should correctly compare the two fractions and return a negative value if the current fraction is less than the given object, a positive value if it's greater, or zero if they are equal.",
