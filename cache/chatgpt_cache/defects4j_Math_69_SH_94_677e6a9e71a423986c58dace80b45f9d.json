                    "content": "Based on the context provided, it seems like the issue is with calculating the p-value for the correlation coefficient by using the cumulative probability of a t-distribution.\n\nOne possible fix is to use the inverse cumulative probability (also known as the quantile function) of the t-distribution to calculate the p-value. Here is the code for this fix:\n\n```java\ndouble p = 2 * (1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(Math.abs(r)));\nout[i][j] = Math.min(p, 1 - p);\n```\n\nThis calculates the p-value by taking twice the complement of the cumulative probability of the absolute t-value. The `Math.min` call is used to ensure that the p-value is at most 1.\n\nThis fix is based on the fact that the absolute t-value follows a t-distribution with nObs-2 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis of zero correlation. The two-tailed p-value for this test is given by twice the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the absolute t-value.",
