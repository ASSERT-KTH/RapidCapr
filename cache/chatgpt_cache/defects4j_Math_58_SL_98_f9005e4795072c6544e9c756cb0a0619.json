In some cases, it returns negative values, which causes the subsequent `fit()` method to fail.\n\nA possible fix for this issue is to check the guess array for negative values and set them to a small positive value. Here's the updated code with the fix:\n\n```java\npublic double[] fit() {\n    final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length; i++) {\n        if (guess[i] < 0) {\n            guess[i] = 1e-10; // set small positive value for negative guess values\n        }\n    }\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n}\n```\n\nPlease try this fix and let me know if it resolves the issue.",
