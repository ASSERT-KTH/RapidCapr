If the `getCumPct` method is defined within the same class as the `getPct` method, you can check if the method name or its signature has been changed or if it has been removed or is no longer accessible. If it has been removed or modified, you need to modify the code accordingly.\n\n2. If the `getCumPct` method is defined in a different class, you need to import that class or use the fully qualified name when calling the method. For example:\n```java\nimport com.example.CumulativePercentageCalculator;\n// ...\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    return CumulativePercentageCalculator.getCumPct((Comparable<? super T>) v);\n}\n```\n\nReplace `com.example.CumulativePercentageCalculator` with the actual package and class name where the `getCumPct` method is defined.\n\nHopefully, one of these solutions will help fix the issue.",
