Based on the code, it is likely that the original code started the loop from `i = 0` instead of `i = word.length() - 2`. Hence, the correct hunk to be inserted in place of the INFILL is: \n\n```java\nfor(int i = 0; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {\n``` \n\nI hope this resolves the issue and the tests pass with this change.",
