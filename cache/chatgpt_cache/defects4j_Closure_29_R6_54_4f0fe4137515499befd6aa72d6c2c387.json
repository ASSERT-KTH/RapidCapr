In the original code, the function checks if any of the references passed in as an argument has a parent that is equal to the current child value. However, this is not sufficient to detect all self-referential assignments. Also, there are some cases where self-referential assignments are orderable and should be inlined. Therefore, I modified the code to only return false if the child value is an ancestor of any of the references passed in, and also to ignore indirect references.",

The `areReferencesConnected` method first checks if the two references are identical or if they are parent/child nodes. If not, it walks the AST upward from each node's parent (up to the nearest block node) and checks whether these walks encounter the nearest common ancestors before encountering any conditional or assignment nodes. If not, the two nodes are not connected and we return `false`.\n\nWith these adjustments, the function should correctly pass the failing test.",
