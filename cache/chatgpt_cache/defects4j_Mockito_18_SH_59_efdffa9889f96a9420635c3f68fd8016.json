Here is the corrected hunk:\n\n```\nreturn m != null && (arg == null ? \"null\" : arg.toString()).equals(StringDescription.toString(m));\n```\n\nThis hunk first checks if the `m` object is not null before calling its `toString()` method to create the string representation. Then it checks if the `arg` object is null, and if it is, uses the string \"null\" instead of calling its `toString()` method to avoid a possible `NullPointerException`. Finally, it compares the string representations of `m` and `arg` using `equals()` to ensure they match.\n\nI hope this helps to resolve the compilation error and fix the underlying issue.",
