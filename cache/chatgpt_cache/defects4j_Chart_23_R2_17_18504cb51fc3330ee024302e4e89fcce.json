Here is a possible fix based on the limited information provided:\n\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    private int width, length;\n\n    public Rectangle(int w, int l) {\n        width = w;\n        length = l;\n    }\n\n    public int getArea() {\n        return width * length;\n    }\n\n    public boolean equals(Rectangle other) {\n        if (other == null)\n            return false;\n        return width == other.width && length == other.length;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe issue with the previous implementation was that the `equals` method was not properly overriding the `equals` method of the `Object` class, which takes an `Object` as an argument, not a `Rectangle` as in this case. The corrected implementation now takes a `Rectangle` argument and properly checks if the other object is `null` before comparing the widths and lengths of the two rectangles.",
