The corrected code assigns `b` to `pat` and added it twice to create the cyclical pattern. The inner for-loop was removed because it is not necessary, and instead an if-statement checks whether the length of `a` is less than `i+l`. Finally, the return statement was moved inside the outer for-loop to return false when the cyclical pattern is not found.",
