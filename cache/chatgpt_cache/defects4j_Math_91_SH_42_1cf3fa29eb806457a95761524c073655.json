Therefore, we need to compare the numerators and denominators of two fractions separately. Here is one possible fix:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = (long) numerator * object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long) object.numerator * denominator;\n    return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\nThis fix uses long arithmetic to avoid integer overflow and returns the result of `Long.compare` between `nOd` and `dOn`, which returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on which one is greater.",
