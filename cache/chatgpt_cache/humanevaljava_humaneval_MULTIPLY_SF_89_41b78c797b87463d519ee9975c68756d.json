The `multiply` function should be written as follows to pass all tests including test_3 and test_0:\n```java\n    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {\n        return a * b;\n    }\n```\nThe failure of test_3 was simply because the function was wrongly implemented and was returning the product of the last digits of the two numbers instead of the product of the two numbers. The failure of test_0 could be due to some other programming error or environmental issue, but the corrected implementation of the `multiply` function should not be contributing to the failure of that test.",
