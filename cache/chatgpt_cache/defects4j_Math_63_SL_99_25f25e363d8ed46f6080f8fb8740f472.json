To fix the issue, you can modify the original buggy line as follows:\n```java\n        return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || (Math.abs(x - y) < Double.MIN_NORMAL);\n```\nThis checks if the absolute difference between x and y is less than Double.MIN_NORMAL, which is the smallest normal value of a double. This ensures that very small deviations between the two double values are considered equal.",
