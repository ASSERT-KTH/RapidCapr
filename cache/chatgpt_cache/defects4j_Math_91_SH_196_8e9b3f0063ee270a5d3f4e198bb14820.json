                    "content": "Based on the error message provided, the issue seems to be that the `compareTo` method is returning `0` instead of `-1`. This indicates that the two fractions being compared are actually equal, rather than one being less than the other. Therefore, it is likely that the incorrect result is being caused by the calculation of `nOd` and `dOn`.\n\nOne possible fix is to calculate `nOd` as the difference between the products of the numerators and denominators, and `dOn` as the product of the denominators:\n\n```java\ndouble nOd = (numerator * object.denominator) - (denominator * object.numerator);\ndouble dOn = denominator * object.denominator;\n```\n\nThis calculation uses the cross-multiplication method commonly used to compare fractions. The numerator of the result fraction is obtained by subtracting the product of the first fraction's numerator and the second fraction's denominator from the product of the second fraction's numerator and the first fraction's denominator. The denominator is simply the product of the two denominators.\n\nWith this hunk, the fixed `compareTo` method would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = (numerator * object.denominator) - (denominator * object.numerator);\n    double dOn = denominator * object.denominator;\n    return (nOd < 0) ? -1 : ((nOd > 0) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the `nOd` comparison is also updated to check against `0`, rather than against `dOn`. This is because the `dOn` value is no longer required for the comparison, and comparing against `0` is a more direct way of checking for the sign of `nOd`.",
