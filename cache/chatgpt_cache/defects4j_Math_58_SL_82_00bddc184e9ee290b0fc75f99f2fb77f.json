However, a possible way to fix it is to add a check to ensure that the guess array has a positive length before calling the `fit` method. Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```java\npublic double[] fit() {\n    final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n    if (guess.length <= 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Guess array must have a positive length\");\n    }\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n}\n```\n\nThis will prevent the `fit` method from being called with an empty or negative length guess array, which is causing the exception in the failing test case.",
