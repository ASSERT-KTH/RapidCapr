This might indicate that the current values for `nOd` and `dOn` are equal when they should not be. Therefore, we can try adding some epsilon value to the calculations to ensure that they are not only equal, but `nOd` is less than `dOn`. Here's a possible fix hunk:\n\n```java\ndouble nOd = numerator * object.denominator + EPSILON;\ndouble dOn = object.numerator * denominator + EPSILON;\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : 1;\n```\n\nWhere `EPSILON` is a small positive value, such as `1e-6`. This adds some small tolerance to the result of the calculation, making sure that `nOd` is always less than `dOn`.",
