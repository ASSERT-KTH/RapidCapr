Here is a general approach to fix the compilation error you are encountering:\n\nThe \"operand expected\" error often occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as a missing semicolon, parentheses or quotes. To fix the error, you need to carefully check the code and look for any missing or misplaced characters.\n\nHere is an example of how to fix an \"operand expected\" error caused by a missing semicolon:\n\n```java\npublic class Example {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 1\n        int y = 2;\n        System.out.println(x + y);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"operand expected\" error is caused by the missing semicolon after the first variable declaration. To fix the error, simply add a semicolon at the end of the line:\n\n```java\npublic class Example {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 1;\n        int y = 2;\n        System.out.println(x + y);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you provide the original code which contains the compilation error and the description of two test cases which caused the failure, I can help further to fix the bug.",
