The correct hunk for the `multiply` method is:\n```java\n    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {\n        return a * b;\n    }\n```\nThe original buggy hunk that was removed was:\n```java\n    return (a % 10) * (b % 10);\n```\nwhich computes the multiplication of the last digits of `a` and `b` instead of the full multiplication.
