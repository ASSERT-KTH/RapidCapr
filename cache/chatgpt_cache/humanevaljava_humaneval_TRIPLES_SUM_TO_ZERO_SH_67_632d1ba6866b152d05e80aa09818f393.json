The first loop runs from `0` to `length - 2` to ensure that the index `i` refers to the first element in each triple. The second loop runs from `i + 1` to `length - 1` to ensure that the index `j` refers to the second element in each triple and is greater than `i`. The third loop runs from `j + 1` to `length` to ensure that the index `k` refers to the third element in each triple and is greater than `j`. This fix should correctly identify the bug and pass the failing test case.",
