Here is the correct fixed code for the `ISCUBE` method:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean iscude(int a) {\n    if (a < 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    double root = Math.pow(a, 1. / 3);\n    BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(root);\n    int round_root = (int) bd.setScale(0, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();\n\n    return ((int) Math.pow(round_root, 3)) == a;\n}\n```\n\nThe issue was caused by the fact that the `iscude` method did not check for negative input values, which caused the calculation of the cubic root to result in a complex number. The added input check ensures that only non-negative integers are processed and that the function returns `false` when given negative inputs.",
