However, the test failure suggests that the expected and actual results of `words_strings` function do not match. \n\nWithout further information on the desired behavior of the function, it is difficult to provide a specific fix. However, it appears that the function is intended to split a comma-separated string into a list of individual words. One possible fix could be to replace the following line:\n```java\nString s_list = \"\";\n```\nwith:\n```java\nStringBuilder s_list = new StringBuilder();\n```\n\nThen, replace the following line:\n```java\ns_list += c;\n```\nwith:\n```java\ns_list.append(c);\n```\nFinally, at the end of the loop, replace the following line:\n```java\ns_list.trim().split(\"\\\\s+\");\n```\nwith:\n```java\ns_list.toString().trim().split(\"\\\\s+\");\n```\n\nThese changes will improve the performance of the function when dealing with very long input strings. \n\nAlternatively, if the desired behavior of the function is simply to split a comma-separated string into individual words, one could replace the entire function with a single line using Java's built-in `String` function, `split`:\n```java\npublic static ArrayList<String> words_strings(String s) {\n    return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(s.split(\",\\\\s*\")));\n}\n```",
