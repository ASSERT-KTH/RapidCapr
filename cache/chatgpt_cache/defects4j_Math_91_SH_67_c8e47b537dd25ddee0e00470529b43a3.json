This indicates that the current hunk is likely not calculating the correct values for nOd and dOn.\n\nBased on the fact that we're comparing fractions, it seems like we need to compare the numerators and denominators separately. Therefore, we can fix the hunk by using the following hunk:\n\n```java\n    long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long)this.denominator * object.numerator;\n```\n\nThis hunk calculates the products of the numerators and denominators separately, then compares them to get the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the final version of the code would be:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long)this.denominator * object.numerator;\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n```",
