It requires a completely different approach to achieve the desired functionality.\n\nHere is one possible correct implementation of the `is_equal_to_sum_even` method:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean is_equal_to_sum_even(int n) {\n    if (n <= 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (i % 2 == 0) {\n            sum += i;\n        }\n    }\n    return n == sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation checks if `n` is equal to the sum of even numbers up to `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to zero, it returns `false`.\n\nI hope this helps to resolve the issue.",
