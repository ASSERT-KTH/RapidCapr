This ensures that all prefixes of the input string are included in the resulting list.\n\n2. `result.add(string.substring(0, i));` - This is an alternative fix that adds the substring starting from index 0 up to index i (exclusive) to the list of result strings. This also includes all prefixes of the input string, but excludes the current character being iterated over in the for loop.",
