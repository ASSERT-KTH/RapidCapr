However, based on the error message, it seems like there may be an issue with the value of the input parameter \"guess\". One possible solution could be to add a check for the positivity of the guess value before using it in the fit() method. Here's an example of what that might look like:\n\n```java\n    public double[] fit() {\n        final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n        if (guess <= 0) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Guess value must be positive\");\n        }\n        return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n    }\n```\n\nThis will throw an error if the guess value is negative or zero, preventing the NotStrictlyPositiveException from being raised later in the code. However, this may not be the best or most accurate solution depending on the specifics of the fit() method.",
