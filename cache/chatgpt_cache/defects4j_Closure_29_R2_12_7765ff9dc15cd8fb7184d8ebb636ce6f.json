Instead of returning `false` immediately if a reference is not a VAR declaration or a simple assignment, we `continue` to the next reference. If we find a reference that meets the criteria and contains a valid object literal assignment, we set `ret` to `true`. Once we have looped through all the references, we return `ret` to indicate whether we have found a valid object literal assignment in any of the references. This approach allows us to avoid premature termination and correctly determine whether the code should be inlined.",
