                    "content": "Based on the description of the error, it seems like the `recordDepScope` method is being called incorrectly when the assignment is the caller expression. Since the comment in the original code mentions that the assignment is being used by the context, it may be appropriate to only record the dependency scope for the RHS of the assignment and not the entire assignment node. With that in mind, the following hunk may fix the issue:\n```java\n        } else if (recordNode == n.getFirstChild() && recordNode.getNext().isCall()) {\n          // If the RHS of the assignment is a call expression, it's used by the\n          // context. Only associate it with the RHS.\n          recordDepScope(recordNode.getNext(), ns);\n        } else {\n          recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n        }\n```\nThis hunk first checks if the recordNode is the LHS of the assignment and if the RHS of the assignment is a call expression. If both of those conditions are true, then it only associates the RHS with the dependency scope. Otherwise, it associates the entire assignment node with the dependency scope as before.",
