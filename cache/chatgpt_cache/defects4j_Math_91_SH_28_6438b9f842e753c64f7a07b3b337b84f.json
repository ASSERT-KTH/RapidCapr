Therefore, the fix hunk should adjust the implementation to correctly compare the fractions. One possible fix for this issue is to use cross-multiplication to compare fractions as follows:\n\n```java\n    public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n        long dOn = object.numerator * (long)denominator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n    }\n```\n\nThis implementation uses cross-multiplication to compare the fractions. It first calculates `nOd` as the product of `numerator` with `object.denominator` and `dOn` as the product of `object.numerator` with `denominator`. Then, it compares `nOd` and `dOn` using `Long.compare()` method and returns the result.\n\nUsing this implementation, the `compareTo()` method should correctly compare the fractions and pass the given test case.",
