However, it seems like the error is related to a parameter being negative or equal to zero, which is not allowed. You could modify the infill line to check the guess array for negative or zero values and adjust them if necessary before returning the result. For example: \n\n```java\n    for (int i = 0; i < guess.length; i++) {\n        if (guess[i] <= 0) {\n            guess[i] = 0.1; // or any other positive value\n        }\n    }\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n``` \n\nThis will ensure that any negative or zero values in `guess` are replaced with a positive value before calling `fit()`. However, a more thorough fix would require understanding what the `fit()` method is supposed to do and why negative or zero values are causing an error.",
