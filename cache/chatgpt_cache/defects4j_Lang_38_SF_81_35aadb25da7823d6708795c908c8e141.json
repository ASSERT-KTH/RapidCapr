In this case, make sure to import the necessary classes or define the method or variable before using them.\n\nIf the error message says \"cannot find symbol class\", it might be because the class is not imported or not defined yet. In this case, make sure to import the necessary classes or define the class before using it.\n\nIf the error message says \"cannot find symbol package\", it might be because the package is not imported or not defined yet.
