Hence, an alternative fix could be to start iterating `j` and `k` from `i + 1` to avoid revisiting the same values. Therefore, the following hunk could fix the issue:\n\n```java\nfor (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j += 1) {\n    for (int k = j + 1; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {\n        if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nThis will ensure that `j` and `k` do not revisit the same value as `i`, which was causing the issue in the original code.",
