The correct hunk for the second code snippet is:\n```java\n        return chromosomes.iterator();\n```\nThis issue seems to be with a unit test that expects an `UnsupportedOperationException` to be thrown when calling the `remove()` method on the iterator returned by `iterator()` method. If you want to make the iterator returned by `iterator()` method read-only, you can use an unmodifiable version of `ArrayList` like this:\n```java\n        return Collections.unmodifiableList(chromosomes).iterator();\n```\nThis will return an iterator that throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` when calling the `remove()` method.",
