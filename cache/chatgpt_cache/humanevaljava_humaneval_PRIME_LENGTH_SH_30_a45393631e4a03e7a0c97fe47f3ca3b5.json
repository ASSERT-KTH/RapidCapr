Therefore, I suggest the following fix hunk that checks for prime length of the string based on the number of divisors:\n```java\npublic static boolean prime_length(String string) {\n    int l = string.length();\n    if (l <= 1)\n        return false;\n    int divisorCount = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= l; i += 1) {\n        if (l % i == 0) {\n            divisorCount += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return divisorCount == 2;\n}\n```\nThis hunk checks for the number of divisors of the string length. A prime length string has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, if the number of divisors is equal to 2, the string length is prime.",
