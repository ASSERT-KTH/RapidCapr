After reviewing the original buggy hunk, the correct fix for the `toStringEquals` method would be to check if `arg` is `null` before calling `toString()` on it, as follows:\n```java\n    private boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n        return StringDescription.toString(m).equals((arg != null) ? arg.toString() : \"null\");\n    }\n```\n\nFor the `readTypeVariables` method, the original buggy hunk is empty, so it is hard to determine the exact problem that causes the test failure. Would you be able to provide more context or information so that I can provide a more appropriate fix?",
