                    "content": "Based on the provided information, it seems like the original buggy hunk was computing `nOd` and `dOn` incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect comparison in the `return` statement of the `compareTo` method. \n\nA possible fix could be to compute `nOd` as the product of the numerator of the first fraction (`this`) and the denominator of the second fraction (`object`), and to compute `dOn` as the product of the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the second fraction. These values should then be cast to a `long`, since the multiplication of two `int`s could result in an overflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct hunk to replace the `>>> [ INFILL ] <<<` line would be:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = (long) numerator * object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long) denominator * object.numerator;\n``` \n\nThis ensures that `nOd` and `dOn` are computed correctly and the `compareTo` method can correctly determine the order of the fractions.",
