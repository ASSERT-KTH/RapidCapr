The original issue with the `same_chars` function is that it only checks if the two lists of characters are equal in terms of their order and contents, but it doesn't check for duplicates of characters in each string. Here's an updated version of the function that checks for duplicates:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean same_chars(String s0, String s1) {\n    if (s0.length() != s1.length()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    Map<Character, Integer> charCounts = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (char c : s0.toCharArray()) {\n        charCounts.merge(c, 1, Integer::sum);\n    }\n\n    for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {\n        if (!charCounts.containsKey(c)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        charCounts.merge(c, -1, Integer::sum);\n\n        if (charCounts.get(c) == 0) {\n            charCounts.remove(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return charCounts.isEmpty();\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a `HashMap` to keep track of the count of each character in the first string. Then it iterates over the characters in the second string, decrementing their count in the map. If the count reaches 0, the character is removed from the map. Finally, if the map is empty at the end of the iteration, it means there were no extra characters in the second string that were not present in the first string.\n\nI hope this updated version of the function resolves the issue.",
