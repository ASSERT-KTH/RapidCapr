The corrected hunk would be:\n\n```java\npublic static int fib(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return n;\n    }\n    int[] memo = new int[n+1];\n    memo[0] = 0;\n    memo[1] = 1;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2];\n    }\n    return memo[n];\n}\n```\n\nThis new implementation is more efficient for large values of n because it eliminates the redundant computation of the same values again and again, since the value of fib(n) depends on the values of fib(n-1) and fib(n-2). The memoization technique stores the values of these subproblems in an array, so that they can be looked up efficiently when needed.",
