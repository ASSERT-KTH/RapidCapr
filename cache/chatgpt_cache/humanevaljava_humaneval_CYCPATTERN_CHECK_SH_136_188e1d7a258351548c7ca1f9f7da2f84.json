Therefore, we create `pat` as `b + b` and loop through the string `a` by `l` character increments, checking if the substring of `a` at that index `i` and length `l` matches the value of `pat` in the corresponding location. If a substring match is found, we know that `b` is a cyclical pattern in `a` and return `true`, otherwise, if the loop exits, we know that `b` is not a cyclical pattern in `a` and return `false`.",
