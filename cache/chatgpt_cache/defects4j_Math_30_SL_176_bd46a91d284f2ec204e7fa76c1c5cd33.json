                    "content": "The most appropriate fix line is:\n```java\nfinal long n1n2prod = (long)n1 * (long)n2;\n```\nExplanation: Since `n1` and `n2` are both integers, their product will also be an integer. But in the original code, the `n1n2prod` variable was declared as a `double`, leading to a loss of precision. By declaring `n1n2prod` as a `long` and casting both `n1` and `n2` to `long` before the multiplication, we avoid this issue and get the correct result.",
