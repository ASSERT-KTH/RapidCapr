Additionally, we need to make sure that `i` is greater than 0 to cover the case where `n` is not divisible by any numbers and we need to return 1 as the largest divisor.\n\nSo an alternative fix line could be:\n```java\nfor (int i = (int) Math.sqrt(n); i > 0; i--) {\n```\nThis line uses the fact that any number `n` has at least one divisor that is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`. Therefore, we can start the loop at `sqrt(n)` and decrement by 1 until we find a divisor. However, note that this line may not be as efficient as the previous line because it involves calculating a square root and casting it to an integer for every input `n`.",
