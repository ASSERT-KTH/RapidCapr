Also, the calculation of the `digit` variable should be `n % 10` instead of `n * 10`, and the product should be multiplied by `digit` instead of divided. Finally, the method should return `-1` when no odd digits are found, instead of `0`, which would be ambiguous (since the product of digits could actually be 0).",

This allows for the case where the remainder is not 1, but is still odd (e.g., -3, which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, but is not odd).",
