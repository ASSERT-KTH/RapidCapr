The issue is with the nested try-catch block when calling `handler.g(t, interpolator.getInterpolatedState())`. If the handler throws an `EventException` from within the solver, the root cause is not properly propagated up to the `evaluateStep` method.\n\nTo fix this, we need to catch `EventException` from the solver and throw it as the cause of `FunctionEvaluationException`. Additionally, we need to update the code to handle the case where the function values at the endpoints of the bracket have the same sign. One possible solution is to use a bisection solver instead of a Brent solver in this case.\n\nThe correct function is:\n\n```java\npublic boolean evaluateStep(final StepInterpolator interpolator)\n        throws DerivativeException, EventException, ConvergenceException {\n\n    try {\n\n        forward = interpolator.isForward();\n        final double t1 = interpolator.getCurrentTime();\n        final int    n  = Math.max(1, (int) Math.ceil(Math.abs(t1 - t0) / maxCheckInterval));\n        final double h  = (t1 - t0) / n;\n\n        double ta = t0;\n        double ga = g0;\n        double tb = t0 + (interpolator.isForward() ? convergence : -convergence);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n            // evaluate handler value at the end of the substep\n            tb += h;\n            interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(tb);\n            final double gb = handler.g(tb, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n\n            // check events occurrence\n            if (g0Positive ^ (gb >= 0)) {\n                // there is a sign change: an event is expected during this step\n\n                // variation direction, with respect to the integration direction\n                increasing = gb >= ga;\n\n                final UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {\n                    public double value(final double t) throws FunctionEvaluationException {\n                        try {\n                            interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(t);\n                            return handler.g(t, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n                        } catch (DerivativeException e) {\n                            throw new FunctionEvaluationException(e, t);\n                        } catch (EventException e) {\n                            throw new FunctionEvaluationException(e, t, e.getCause());\n                        }\n                    }\n                };\n\n                // Check if the function values at the endpoints have different signs\n                final double fa = handler.g(ta, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n                final double fb = handler.g(tb, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n                if (fa * fb >= 0) {\n                    // The function values at the endpoints do not have different signs.\n                    // Use a bisection solver instead of a Brent solver.\n                    final BisectionSolver bisector = new BisectionSolver();\n                    bisector.setAbsoluteAccuracy(convergence);\n                    bisector.setMaximalIterationCount(maxIterationCount);\n                    final double root = bisector.solve(f, ta, tb);\n                    if ((Math.abs(root - ta) <= convergence) && (Math.abs(root - previousEventTime) <= convergence)) {\n                        // we have either found nothing or found (again ?) a past event, we simply ignore it\n                        ta = tb;\n                        ga = gb;\n                    } else if (Double.isNaN(previousEventTime) || (Math.abs(previousEventTime - root) > convergence)) {\n                        pendingEventTime = root;\n                        if (pendingEvent && (Math.abs(t1 - pendingEventTime) <= convergence)) {\n                            // we were already waiting for this event which was\n                            // found during a previous call for a step that was\n                            // rejected, this step must now be accepted since it\n                            // properly ends exactly at the event occurrence\n                            return false;\n                        }\n                        // either we were not waiting for the event or it has\n                        // moved in such a way the step cannot be accepted\n                        pendingEvent = true;\n                        return true;\n                    }\n\n                } else {\n                    // The function values at the endpoints have different signs.
