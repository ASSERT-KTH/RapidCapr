It checks whether the parent of the recorded node is a call expression and whether the grandparent of the recorded node is an expression statement. If both conditions are true, it means that the recorded node is the argument of a function call and it is the last child of the call expression. In this case, it records the dependency scope of the call expression instead of the recorded node.",
