The modified implementation checks if a `childVal` is equal to a `Reference` node's value or parent node, which is a more precise check for self-referential assignments. Then, we check if the self-referential assignment is orderable. A self-referential assignment is orderable if its next sibling is the top level statement or another inlineable assignment left-hand side.",
