The loop should start from `i=2` and end at `i<=n` instead of `i=n-1`, because we need to fill the entire sequence of length `n`.\n2. In the original code, the if condition `(i % 2 == 0)` belonged to the wrong branch of the `if-else` statement. It should be used to set the value of sequence[i] when `i` is even.\n3. The formula used to calculate the sequence value was incorrect in the original code. The correct formula is `sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] - sequence[i - 2]` for odd values of `i` and `sequence[i] = i/2` for even values of `i`.",
