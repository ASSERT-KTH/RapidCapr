Based on the error message `junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: en: 0 \u00df SS`, it seems like the issue is related to the German character `\u00df` being converted to `SS` by the `toUpperCase()` method.

It's difficult to determine the exact issue without more information about the test case and the error message. \n\nHowever, one possible issue could be related to the use of `regionMatches()` method. It compares two substrings of the given strings, starting from the specified indices. This can lead to incorrect results if the indices are not set correctly. \n\nOne way to fix the infill location could be to use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lower case and then compare them using the `equals()` method. This would compare the entire strings instead of just a substring. \n\nThe correct hunk for the infill location should be:\n```java\n        return str.toLowerCase().equals(searchStr.toLowerCase());\n``` \n\nPlease try this fix and let me know if it solves the issue.",
