However, in cases where the zero is very close to the initial interval endpoints, the function evaluation at the endpoints may have the same sign because of numerical precision issues and doubling the interval size may not properly capture the zero. \n\nThe fix is to continue to double the interval until the function evaluation at the endpoints has different signs or until the interval size is very small (defined as less than `1e-10`).",
