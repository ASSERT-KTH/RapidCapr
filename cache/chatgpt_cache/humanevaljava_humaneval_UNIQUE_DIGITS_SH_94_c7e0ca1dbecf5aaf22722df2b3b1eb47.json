However, `all_odd` should only be set to `true` if all the digits in the number are odd. Therefore, we need to set `all_odd` to `false` as soon as we encounter a digit that is even and break out of the loop. This way, the loop will keep running until all the digits in the number have been checked, and `all_odd` will only be `true` if all the digits are odd.",
