One way to do this is by using a regular expression to split the input string at commas and spaces, and then iterating over the resulting string array to add each word to the `result` ArrayList. Here's a possible line of code to achieve this:\n\n```java\nString[] result_array = s.split(\"[,\\\\s]+\");\n```\n\nThis regular expression matches one or more occurrences of commas or whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) as the delimiter for splitting the input string.",
