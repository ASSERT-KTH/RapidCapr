This might mean that either the numerator or the denominator is being calculated incorrectly. \nTo ensure correct numerator and denominator calculations, we can use the following hunk:\n```java\n    double nOd = this.numerator * (double)object.denominator;\n    double dOn = object.numerator * (double)this.denominator;\n```\nHere, we calculate the numerator by multiplying the current numerator with object's denominator and calculate the denominator by multiplying the object's numerator with the current denominator. We typecast the numerator or the denominator to double before performing the multiplication to ensure that we get the accurate result. This hunk should fix the bug.",
