Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the syntax of the code is still incorrect.\n\nGiven the error message, it's likely that there is still a syntax error in the code. Here's what I suggest: since the original buggy line that was removed contained a variable declaration, it's possible that there is a missing or incorrect type declaration in the code. \n\nPlease check the lines immediately preceding the buggy line. Do any of them declare a variable without specifying its type? If so, please add the appropriate type declaration (e.g. `int`, `String`, etc.) before the variable name.\n\nOnce you've taken care of any missing type declarations, please try the following fixed line at the infill location:\n\n```java\nContext rhsContext = Context.OTHER;\n```\n\nThis line initializes the `rhsContext` variable to a valid value, using the `OTHER` enum value provided by the `Context` class.\n\nI hope this version will fix the issue.
