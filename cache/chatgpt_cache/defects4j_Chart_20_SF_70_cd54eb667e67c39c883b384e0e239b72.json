This causes the `outlinePaint` to be the same as `paint`, which is why the test fails.\n\nThe alternative fix function removes the redundant `paint` and `stroke` arguments from the `super` constructor call, and then checks if `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` are not null before calling `setOutlinePaint` and `setOutlineStroke`. If they are null, it defaults to using the `fillPaint` and `fillStroke` for the outline. This ensures that the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` are set correctly, and should fix the test failure.",
