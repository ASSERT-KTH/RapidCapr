                    "content": "Based on the provided information, it seems that the original implementation was comparing the double values of the fractions, instead of the fractions themselves. Therefore, an alternative fix could be to compare the numerators and denominators of the fractions directly. \n\nThe proposed fix hunk is:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = numerator * (long) object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long) denominator * object.numerator;\n    return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\nThis implementation multiplies the numerator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second fraction and the numerator of the second fraction with the denominator of the first fraction, which results in two long values representing the numerators of the two fractions. These values are then compared using the `Long.compare()` method, which returns -1, 0 or 1, depending on the comparison result.",
