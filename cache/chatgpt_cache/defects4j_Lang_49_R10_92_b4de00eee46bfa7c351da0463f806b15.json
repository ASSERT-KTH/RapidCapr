As per the error message, the method seems to be missing in the current implementation.\n\nHere's a corrected implementation for the `reduce` method that should fix the issue:\n\n```\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    return new Fraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n}\n``` \n\nThis implementation creates and returns a new `Fraction` instance with the reduced numerators and denominators.\n\nI hope this helps!
