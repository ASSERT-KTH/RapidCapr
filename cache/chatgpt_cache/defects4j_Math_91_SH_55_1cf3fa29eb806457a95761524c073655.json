                    "content": "Based on the test error message, it seems that the current implementation of `compareTo` method is not returning the expected value. \nSince the original buggy hunk is not available, I suggest the following fix:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n        long nOd = (long)numerator * object.denominator;\n        long dOn = (long)object.numerator * denominator;\n        return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\nHere, we multiply the numerator of the current fraction with the denominator of the argument fraction to get the nOd value, and we multiply the numerator of the argument fraction with the denominator of the current fraction to get the dOn value. These values are then compared using the `Long.compare()` method which returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second argument. This ensures that we get the correct comparison result for the two fractions.",
