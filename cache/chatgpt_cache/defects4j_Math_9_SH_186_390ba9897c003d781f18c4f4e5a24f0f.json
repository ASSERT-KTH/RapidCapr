Then, `revertedEndPoint` is computed by subtracting `direction` from `zero`. Finally, using `zero` and `revertedEndPoint`, a new `Line` instance is created and returned.",

However, the `final` keyword has been removed from their declarations, as it may be causing a compilation error in your specific environment. Also, the `Line` instance is now assigned to `reverted` in a separate line. \n\nI hope this will fix the issue.",
