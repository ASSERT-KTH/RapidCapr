However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like there is an issue with an equals sign (=) that is not used correctly. Here is an example of how an equals sign could be used incorrectly:\n\n```java\nint x = 5;\nif (x = 10) { // should be x == 10, not x = 10\n    System.out.println(\"x is equal to 10\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the if statement should be checking whether x is equal to 10, but instead it is assigning the value of 10 to x with a single equals sign. The correct syntax for comparing two values is to use a double equals sign (==).\n\nHere is a corrected version of the code:\n\n```java\nint x = 5;\nif (x == 10) { // corrected to use == instead of =\n    System.out.println(\"x is equal to 10\");\n}\n```\n\nAgain, without seeing the original code or the test case, I can only provide a general example.
