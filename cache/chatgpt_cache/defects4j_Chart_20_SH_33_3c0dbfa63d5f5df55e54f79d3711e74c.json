Therefore, it is likely that the issue is with the `outlinePaint` parameter not being set properly.\n\nAssuming that the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` parameters are intended to set the outline properties of the marker, the following fix could resolve the issue:\n\n```java\nsuper(paint, stroke, alpha);\nsetOutlinePaint(outlinePaint);\nsetOutlineStroke(outlineStroke);\nthis.value = value;\n```\nThis code sets the `paint`, `stroke`, and `alpha` properties using the `ValueMarker` constructor as the original code does. However, it sets the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` properties using the appropriate setter methods provided by the `Marker` parent class. \n\nThis fix also assumes that the outline properties are not required to be set in the constructor parameters but can be set after the marker object is instantiated. If this is not the case, the `Marker` class should be updated to provide appropriate constructor options.",
