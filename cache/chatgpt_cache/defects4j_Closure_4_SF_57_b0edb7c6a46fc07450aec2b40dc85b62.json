The main difference here is that the `super.resolveInternal()` method and the finish property continuations call is placed outside of the `if-else` statement, so it will always be executed, yet the result of the resolution is returned using the `result` variable. This should prevent the `StackOverflowError`.",

If we resolved via registry, we handle the `detectImplicitPrototypeCycle`, call `super.resolveInternal()`, and finish property continuations. If we resolved via properties, we handle the `detectImplicitPrototypeCycle`, call `super.resolveInternal()`, but only finish property continuations if the type is resolved. Finally, if we didn't resolve via registry or properties, we just call `super.resolveInternal()` and finish property continuations if the type is resolved.\n\nI hope this fixes the issue.",
