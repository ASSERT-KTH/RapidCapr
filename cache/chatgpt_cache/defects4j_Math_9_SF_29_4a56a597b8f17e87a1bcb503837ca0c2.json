In the original code, the direction vector is subtracted from a zero vector to create the new line, which is mathematically correct, but may introduce rounding errors due to the imprecision of floating-point arithmetic. In the corrected code, the direction vector is directly negated to create the new line, avoiding any potential rounding errors.",

This can be achieved by creating a new `Vector2D` object from the negation of the direction component-wise, and then using that new vector to construct a new `Line` object with the same point as the original `Line`. This solution avoids the potential for rounding errors introduced by the previous implementation, which subtracts the direction vector from a zero vector to create the new line.",
