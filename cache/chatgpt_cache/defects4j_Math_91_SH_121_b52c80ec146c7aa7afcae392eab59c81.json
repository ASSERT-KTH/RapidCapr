                    "content": "Based on the error message and the expected result, it seems that the current implementation of the `compareTo` method is not correctly comparing the two `Fraction` objects. One possible fix is to first compute a common denominator between the two fractions and then compare their numerators. The correct hunk for the infill location could be:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = object.numerator * (long)this.denominator;\nreturn Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n```\n\nThis implementation first computes the product of `this.numerator` and `object.denominator` and stores it in `nOd`. It then computes the product of `object.numerator` and `this.denominator` and stores it in `dOn`. Finally, it returns the result of comparing `nOd` and `dOn`. This implementation avoids the use of floating point arithmetic, which can introduce rounding errors and lead to incorrect results.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the result of the comparison can fit in a `long`. If the fractions are very large, this may not be the case and a more sophisticated implementation may be needed.",
