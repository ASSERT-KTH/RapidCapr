Therefore, we need to come up with a hunk that correctly calculates the numerical values of two fractions and compares them. Out of the provided hunks, the following implementation should fix the bug:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = (long)numerator * object.denominator;\nlong dOn = (long)object.numerator * denominator;\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly calculates the numerical values of the two fractions and compares them. It first multiplies the numerator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second fraction, and then multiplies the numerator of the second fraction with the denominator of the first fraction. It then compares the two values to determine the ordering of the fractions. Since the calculation involves multiplication, we need to convert the result into a `long` to prevent overflow.",
