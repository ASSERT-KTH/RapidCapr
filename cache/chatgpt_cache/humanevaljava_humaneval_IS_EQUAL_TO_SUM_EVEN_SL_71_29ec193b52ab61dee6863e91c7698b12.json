Based on the test error you provided, it seems that the current implementation of `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` is returning `true` even though the expected value is `false` when the input is `4`.\n\nOne possible correct implementation of `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` to pass this test could be:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean is_equal_to_sum_even(int n) {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        sum += i;\n    }\n    return sum % 2 == 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation computes the sum of integers from 1 to `n` and returns `true` if the sum is even and `false` otherwise. \n\nI hope this helps to fix the issue.",
