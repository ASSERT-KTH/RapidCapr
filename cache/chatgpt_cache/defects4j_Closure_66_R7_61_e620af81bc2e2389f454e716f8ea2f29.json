However, based on the test error message, it seems like the `getTypedPercent` function is not returning the expected output. \n\nOne possible fix for this could be to ensure that the function correctly counts the number of typed variables and total variables in the input code, and then returns the percentage of typed variables. Here is an example implementation of such a function:\n\n```java\npublic double getTypedPercent(String code) {\n    int numTyped = 0;\n    int total = 0;\n    \n    // Iterate through each variable in the code\n    Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile(\"var\\\\s+(\\\\w+)\\\\s*=\").matcher(code);\n    while (matcher.find()) {\n        total++;\n        String varName = matcher.group(1);\n        \n        // Check if the variable is typed\n        Matcher typeMatcher = Pattern.compile(varName + \"\\\\s*:\\\\s*(\\\\w+)\").matcher(code);\n        if (typeMatcher.find()) {\n            numTyped++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (total > 0) {\n        return (double) numTyped / total * 100.0;\n    } else {\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nNote that this implementation assumes that typed variables in the code are always declared with the `var` keyword, followed by the variable name, a colon, and then the variable type. The function uses regex patterns to extract the variable names and types from the code.",
