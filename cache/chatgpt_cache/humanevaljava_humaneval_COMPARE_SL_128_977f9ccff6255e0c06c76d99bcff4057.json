Given the failed test case, it seems that the correct solution for the infill location is to replace the original buggy line `result[i] = Math.floorDiv(game[i], guess[i]);` with the following line:\n```java\n            if (guess[i] == 0) {\n                result[i] = -1; // or any appropriate error value\n            } else {\n                result[i] = game[i] / guess[i];\n            }\n``` \n\nThis solution checks for the case when `guess[i] == 0` and returns an error value (`-1` in this case). Otherwise, it performs a regular integer division (`game[i] / guess[i]`). Note that if the original code intended to perform floating point division, then the division should be changed to `game[i] / (double)guess[i]`.",
