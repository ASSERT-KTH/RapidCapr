Upon further review, I think the issue may be with the approach being taken to count the number of words with an odd-numbered first letter. Rather than incrementing the count whenever a character is found that satisfies the specified conditions, we should only increment the count when we encounter the first character of a new word that satisfies the conditions. Here's the updated code for the infill location that should address the issue:\n```java\nif(Character.isLetter(curr) && Character.isUpperCase(curr)) {\n    if(count % 2 == 0) {\n        count++;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code should correctly count the number of words in the input string that have an even-numbered first letter (which is what we want since we are checking for failure on `test_4`).",
