However, the failing test `testGetTypedPercent5` indicates that there is an issue with the `getTypedPercent` function. Here is a potential fix for the function:\n\n```java\npublic double getTypedPercent(String js) {\n    double typed = 0.0;\n    double total = 0.0;\n    for (String line : js.split(\"\\\\r?\\\\n\")) {\n        line = line.trim();\n        if (!line.startsWith(\"//\")) {\n            total += 1.0;\n            if (line.matches(\".*[a-zA-Z]+.*\")) {\n                typed += 1.0;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (total == 0) {\n        return 100.0;\n    } else {\n        return 100.0 * (typed / total);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis updated function splits the input `js` string into individual lines and iterates through them. It skips any lines that start with `//` to exclude comments. For each line, it checks if it contains any alphabetical characters using a regular expression. If it does, it increments `typed`. It also increments `total` for every line that passes the comment check. Finally, it calculates and returns the percentage of `typed` lines out of total non-comment lines. If `total` is 0, it returns 100 to avoid a divide-by-zero error.",
