Therefore, it is difficult to provide a specific fix for this problem. \n\nHowever, assuming that the original buggy code was removed because it caused the test failure, one possible fix hunk that could be provided is:\n\n``` java\n// using the for-loop conditions from the original buggy hunk\nfor (int j = i; j < numbers.length; j += 1) {\n    for (int k = j + 1; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {\n        if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] + numbers[k] == 0)\n            return true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code snippet includes the original for-loop conditions mentioned in the prompt and avoids checking the same pair of numbers twice by starting the inner `k` loop from `j + 1`. By doing so, we can ensure that each pair of numbers is considered only once for the summation.\n\nNote that this fix hunk assumes that the original buggy code was removed because it failed the test case and that the test case is checking if there exist three numbers such that their sum equals to zero. However, without more information, it is difficult to make assumptions about the original bug and the test case failure.",
