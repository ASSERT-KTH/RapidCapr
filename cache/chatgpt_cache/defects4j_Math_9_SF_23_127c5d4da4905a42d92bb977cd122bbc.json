A more precise way to negate a vector is to use the `negate` method provided by the vector class, which provides exact computation for vectors in Euclidean space.",

In this case, we want to only negate the direction of the line while keeping the `zero` point the same.\n\nWe can create a new `Vector2D` object with the negative components of the `direction` vector by manually negating the x and y components. We then use this new vector to create a new Line object with the same `zero` point as the original line. This produces the correct negation of the direction vector.",
