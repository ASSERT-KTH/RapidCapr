To fix the original problem where the function `truncate_number` is not correctly truncating the input number to one decimal place, you can use the following hunk:\n\n```java\n        return Math.floor(number * 10.0) / 10.0;\n```\n\nThis should truncate the input number to one decimal place by multiplying it by 10, taking the floor of the result, and then dividing by 10.0 to shift the decimal point back one place.
