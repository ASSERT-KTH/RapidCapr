It should be `i++` instead of `i--`.\n- The loop should run till `n + 1` instead of `n - 1`.\n- In the else block, the formula for calculating sequence[i] was incorrect. It should be `sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] - sequence[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2;` instead of `sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] - sequence[i - 2] - (i + 3) / 2;`",

The issue with the `add()` function can be fixed by applying the bitwise OR operation in it as a logical OR operation, which would work correctly for the test cases used. Here's the updated `add()` function that should fix the problem:\n\n```java\npublic static int add(int x, int y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n```\n\nAnd for the `tri()` function, there is another issue in the sequence calculation. Here's the updated version of the `tri()` function:\n\n```java\npublic static int[] tri(int n) {\n    int[] sequence = new int[n + 1];\n    if (n == 0) {\n        sequence[0] = 1;\n        return sequence;\n    }\n    sequence[0] = 1;\n    sequence[1] = -3;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        if (i % 2 == 0) {\n            sequence[i] = i / 2 - 1;\n        } else {\n            sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] - sequence[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2;\n        }\n    }\n    return sequence;\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, the loop goes from `2` to `n` inclusive, and the formula for the calculation of the sequence element at odd indices is fixed by changing the `-` operator to `+`.",
