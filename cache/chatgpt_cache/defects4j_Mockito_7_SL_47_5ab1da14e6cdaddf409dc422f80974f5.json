Here's a corrected solution for the first code snippet.\n\nThe problem is that when `arg` is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown when `arg.toString()` is called. To fix this, we need to check if `arg` is `null`. If it is, we can compare it with the String \"null\", which is what the `null` value would be converted to anyway.\n\nHere's the corrected line:\n\n```java\nreturn StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg == null ? \"null\" : arg.toString());\n```\n\nThis should fix the `NullPointerException` and make the test pass.",
