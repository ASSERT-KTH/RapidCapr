This line checks if the last character in the string is 'e' and if the vowel count is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, it subtracts 1 from the vowel count. This is because words ending with 'e' may not have a vowel sound (e.g. \"love\", \"like\").\n2. This line checks if the last character in the string is 'y' and if the vowel count is greater than 0. If both conditions are met, it subtracts 1 from the vowel count. This is because when 'y' appears at the end of a word, it may not be considered a vowel (e.g. \"cry\", \"dry\").",
