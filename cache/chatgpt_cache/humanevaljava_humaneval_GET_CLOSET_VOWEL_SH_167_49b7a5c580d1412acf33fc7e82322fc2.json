The current logic checks for vowels only between non-vowels, i.e., it checks for a vowel surrounded by consonants, but it should find the closest vowel to the beginning of the word. To fix this, change the condition to check for a vowel and break out of the loop once a vowel is found (since the loop starts from the end of the word, the first found vowel will be the closest to the beginning):\n\n```java\n        for (int i = word.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (vowels.contains(word.charAt(i))) {\n                return word.substring(i, i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nWith this change, the method returns the closest vowel in a given word.",
