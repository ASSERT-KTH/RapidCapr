Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the division operator was used on integers, which can truncate the result and cause incorrect output. \n\nHere is a possible corrected line for the infill location that uses floating point division instead of integer division:\n\n```java\nresult[i] = (int)Math.floor(game[i] / (double)guess[i]);\n``` \n\nThis line first casts the second operand `guess[i]` to a `double`, which allows for floating point division to be used when dividing by `game[i]`. The `Math.floor` method is used to round down the result of the division to the nearest integer, as required by the problem description. Finally, this result is cast back to an `int` before being stored in `result[i]`.",
