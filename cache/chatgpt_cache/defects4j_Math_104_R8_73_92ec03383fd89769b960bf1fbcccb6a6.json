To fix the compilation error, please add the following line at the infill location:\n\n```\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\n\nThe error in the failing test is likely due to the precision of the epsilon used in the `assert` statement. The `10e-15` value used in the `TestUtils.assertEquals` method call is actually equivalent to `1.0E-14`, which may not be precise enough to account for the difference between `expected` and `actualP`. By changing the value of `DEFAULT_EPSILON` to `1e-9`, the default precision used in the corresponding `assertEquals` call should be sufficient to account for any differences between `expected` and `actualP`.",

Here is the correct code to fix the issue.\n\nPlease replace the infill location with the following code snippet:\n\n```java\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\n\nThe issue in the original code may have been caused by the use of `10e-9` in `DEFAULT_EPSILON`. The correct way to represent scientific notation in Java is to use `E` instead of `e`, so the correct representation of `10e-9` would be `10E-9`. However, a better practice is to use the more common `1e-9` notation for better readability and compatibility.",
