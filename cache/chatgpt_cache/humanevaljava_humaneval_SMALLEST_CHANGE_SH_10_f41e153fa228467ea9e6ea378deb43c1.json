A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same way backward as it does forward.\n\n- The corrected hunk iterates only over the first half of the array (since we are comparing each element to its corresponding element on the other side of the array).\n\n- For each iteration, we check if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[arr.length - i - 1]` (the corresponding element on the other side of the array). \n\n- If the elements do not match, we add 1 to `result`.\n\n- Finally, we return `result` which represents the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array a palindrome.",
