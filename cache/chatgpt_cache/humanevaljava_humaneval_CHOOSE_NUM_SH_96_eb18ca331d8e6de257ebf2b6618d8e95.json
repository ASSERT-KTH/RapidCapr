This is because the original hunk removed compared `x` and `y`, but the infill location did not provide this information, so it is safer to assume that if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then the function should return -1. This will prevent the function from returning incorrect results in cases where `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.",
