However, here is a possible fix hunk that could address the issue:\n\n```java\nif (ns != null) {\n  if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n    if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n) {\n      recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n    } else {\n      recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);\n    }\n  } else if (!n.getParent().isCall()) {\n    recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis fix checks if the parent of the current node is a call expression before calling `recordDepScope` with `recordNode` as the first argument. If it is a call expression, it skips the `recordDepScope` call and continues to the next `else if` block, which handles the case where the parent is a `for` loop.\n\nPlease note that this fix is based on assumptions and may not be the optimal solution for the issue. It is recommended to perform further analysis and testing to come up with a more appropriate fix.",
