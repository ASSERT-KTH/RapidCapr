                    "content": "Based on the given test error, it seems that the original buggy code wrongly returns 0 instead of -1. This suggests that the comparison result is not correctly computed. Therefore, the correct hunk should compute the comparison result accurately.\n\nOne way to do this is by first cross-multiplying the fractions and then comparing their numerators. This can be done with the following hunk:\n```java\nlong nOd = numerator * (long)object.denominator - (long)object.numerator * denominator;\nreturn (nOd < 0) ? -1 : (nOd > 0 ? 1 : 0);\n```\nThis hunk computes the difference between the cross-multiplications `numerator * object.denominator` and `denominator * object.numerator` as `nOd`. If `nOd` is negative, then the fraction is less than `object`, so it returns -1. If `nOd` is positive, then the fraction is greater than `object`, and it returns 1. Otherwise, the fractions are equal, and it returns 0.\n\nNote that we cast one of the cross-multiplications to `long` to prevent integer overflow when dealing with large numbers.",
