We check this using a condition in the loop header.\n    - Similarly, in the `k` loop, we can optimize the iterations by adding a condition to check if the sum of the current triple is less than or equal to 3*n*n.\n- The condition to test if the sum of the triple is divisible by 3 is left unchanged, as it is correct.",
