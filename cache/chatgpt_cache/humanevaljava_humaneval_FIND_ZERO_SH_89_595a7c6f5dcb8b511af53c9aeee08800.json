Here's another possible solution to fix the issue:\n\n```java\npublic static double find_zero(List<Double> xs){\n    double begin = -1.;\n    double end = 1.;\n\n    while (poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, end) > 0) {\n        begin *= 2.;\n        end *= 2.;\n    }\n    while (end - begin > 1e-10) {\n        double center = (begin + end) / 2.0;\n\n        if (Math.abs(poly(xs, center)) < 1e-10) {\n            return center;\n        } else if (poly(xs, begin) * poly(xs, center) < 0) {\n            end = center;\n        } else {\n            begin = center;\n        }\n    }\n    return begin;\n}\n```\nThe issue with the previous fix was that it did not handle the case where the function value at the midpoint of the interval is zero. In this case, the midpoint itself should be returned as the root. The updated code addresses this by checking if the absolute value of the function at the midpoint is less than a small epsilon value, and returning the midpoint if this is the case.",
