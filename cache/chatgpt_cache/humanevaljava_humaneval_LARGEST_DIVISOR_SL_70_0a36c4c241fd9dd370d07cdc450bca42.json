                    "content": "Based on the error message, it seems like the function is currently always returning 1, which suggests that the loop is not finding any divisors of `n`.\n\nTo fix this, we could change the loop to start from `n/2` and go down to 1, since no divisor of `n` can be greater than `n/2`. Additionally, we should check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the equality operator instead of the assignment operator. Therefore, the correct fix line at the infill location is:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = n/2; i >= 1; i--) {\n    if (n % i == 0)\n        return i;\n}\n``` \n\nThis will start the loop from `n/2` and check for divisors until it gets to 1. If a divisor is found, it will be returned immediately. If no divisor is found, the function will return 1 as before.",
