Based on the error message you have provided, it seems like the division operation is causing an ArithmeticException when the divisor (`guess[i]`) is 0. In that case, you can catch the exception and set the corresponding result element to 0. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```java\npublic static int[] compare(int[] game, int[] guess) {\n    int[] result = new int[game.length];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < game.length; i += 1) {\n        try {\n            result[i] = Math.floorDiv(game[i], guess[i]);\n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n            result[i] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis code tries to perform the division operation normally, but if an ArithmeticException is thrown (indicating division by zero), it catches the exception and sets the result element to 0 instead. This should prevent the test failure caused by the ArithmeticException.",
