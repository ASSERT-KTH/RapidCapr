The expected string has double quotes escaped with `&quot;`, while the actual string has double quotes escaped with backslashes `\\`. \n\nTo fix the issue, we can modify the `generateToolTipFragment` method to escape double quotes with `&quot;` using the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4` method from the `org.apache.commons.lang3` library. Here's the modified hunk that should be inserted at the `>>> [ INFILL ] <<<` position:\n\n```java\n        return \" title=\\\"\" + StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(toolTipText)\n            + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n``` \n\nThis should properly escape double quotes and fix the `testGenerateURLFragment` test failure.",
