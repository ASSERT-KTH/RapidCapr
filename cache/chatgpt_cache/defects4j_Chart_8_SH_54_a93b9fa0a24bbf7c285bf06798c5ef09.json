However, here are some potential fix hunks that could address the issue:\n\n5. ```java\nthis(time, zone);\n```\nThis assumes that the `Locale` parameter is not necessary for the `Week` constructor, as it was not included in the available buggy hunk.\n\n6. ```java\nthis(new Date(time.getTime() + zone.getRawOffset()), zone);\n```\nThis assumes that the issue is related to the time zone offset not being applied to the input `Date` correctly. We add the offset to the input `Date` before passing it to the constructor.\n\nPlease choose the fix hunk that best addresses the issue based on further analysis of the code and the purpose of the `Week` constructor.",
