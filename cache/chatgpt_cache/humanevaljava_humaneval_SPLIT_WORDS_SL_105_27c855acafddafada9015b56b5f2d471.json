Here are some other possible implementations that could fix the issue:\n\n1. ```java\n   if(Character.isUpperCase(curr) && (i + 1 == txt.length() || Character.isWhitespace(txt.charAt(i + 1))) && (curr - 'A') % 2 == 0) count++;\n   ```\n   This implementation checks if the current character is an uppercase letter, and if it's followed by a whitespace character (indicating the end of a word). It also ensures that the letter is an even-numbered one by checking if its ASCII value modulo 2 is zero. \n\n2. ```java\n   if(Character.isLetter(curr) && !Character.isLowerCase(curr) && (i == 0 || Character.isWhitespace(txt.charAt(i - 1)))) {\n        if ((curr - 'A') % 2 == 0) count++;\n   }\n   ```\n   This implementation checks if the current character is a letter and not a lowercase letter. It also ensures that the letter is at the beginning of a word by checking if it's the first character in the string or is preceded by a whitespace character. Finally, it checks if the letter is an even-numbered one by checking if its ASCII value modulo 2 is zero.\n\nI hope one of these implementations will fix the issue correctly.",
