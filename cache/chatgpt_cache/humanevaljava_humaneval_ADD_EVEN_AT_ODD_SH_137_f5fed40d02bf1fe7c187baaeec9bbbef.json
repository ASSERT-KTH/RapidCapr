The first alternative fix hunk starts from index 1 which is an odd index, and increments the loop counter by 2 to only access the even indices in the array. The second alternative fix hunk starts from index 0 but increments the loop counter by 2 to only access the odd indices in the array. Both hunk alternatives will only add even numbers at odd indices, as specified in the test case.",
