However, as the comment in the code mentions,\n   ```\n   * This is either the variable declaration (\"var a = ...\") or first\n   * reference following the declaration if it is an assignment.\n   ```\n   we need to check `references.get(index + 1)` instead of `references.get(index)` which is the next reference after the declaration. The code also checks if the `references.get(index + 1)` is not out of bounds.",
