After reviewing the code again, it seems that the correction I provided is not relevant to the error you are encountering.\n\nBased on the test error message, it appears that there is an issue with the time zone when formatting the calendar object. The expected date time is in UTC (`Z`), and the test error shows a difference of eight hours between the expected and the actual date time. This difference suggests that the time zone offset for the current locale was applied twice during the formatting.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the line at the infill location as follows:\n```java\ncalendar.setTimeZone(mTimeZone);\ncalendar.setTimeInMillis(calendar.getTimeInMillis() - calendar.getTimeZone().getOffset(calendar.getTimeInMillis()));\n```\nThis sets the calendar object's time zone to the forced time zone, and then subtracts the time zone offset from the calendar time to get the UTC time. This should fix the test failure.",
