After reviewing the problem again, the issue is that the `reduce()` method does not handle negative denominators correctly. Here is an updated solution that should fix the issue:\n\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));\n    if (denominator < 0) {\n        gcd = -gcd;\n    }\n    int newNumerator = numerator / gcd;\n    int newDenominator = denominator / gcd;\n    return new Fraction(newNumerator, newDenominator);\n}\n```\n\nThis updated solution first finds the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the numerator and denominator. If the denominator is negative, the gcd is negated. The numerator and denominator are then divided by the gcd to get the simplified fraction. Finally, a new Fraction object is created with the simplified numerator and denominator. This should handle negative denominators correctly and produce the correct output for the test case you provided.",
