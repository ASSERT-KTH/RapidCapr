This means we were adding the even numbers at indices 1, 3, 5, ..., which is not what the prompt asks for. The prompt asks for even numbers at even indices, i.e., 0, 2, 4, .... Therefore, we need to change the loop to iterate over even indices of the array, which would be 0, 2, 4, ..., or 1, 3, 5, ... depending on whether we start the loop from 0 or 1. Both the fix hunks accomplish this and should pass the given test case.",
