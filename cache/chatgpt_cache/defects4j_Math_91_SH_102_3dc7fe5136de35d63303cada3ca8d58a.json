Therefore, we can assume that the bug is in the current hunk that was removed. We need to find a way to correctly calculate the comparison between two fractions.\n\nOne way to compare fractions is to calculate the numerator of the difference of the two fractions and compare it with zero. If the numerator is negative, then the first fraction is less than the second one. If it is positive, then the first fraction is greater than the second one. Otherwise, the two fractions are equal.\n\nWe can implement this method by computing the numerator of the difference as `numerator * object.denominator - object.numerator * denominator`.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix for the removed hunk is:\n\n```java\ndouble nOd = numerator * object.denominator - object.numerator * denominator;\ndouble dOn = denominator * object.numerator - numerator * object.denominator;\n``` \n\nOption 8 from the given hunks is the same as the correct fix.",
