This is done using three loops:\n1. `for (int i = 0; i < n-2; i += 1)` to iterate through all possible values of i except the last two.\n2. `for (int j = i+1; j < n-1; j += 1)` to iterate through all possible values of j greater than i.\n3. `for (int k = j+1; k < n; k += 1)` to iterate through all possible values of k greater than j.\n\nThe original buggy hunk had the nested loops starting at 0 rather than i+1 and j+1, resulting in some triples being counted twice. The correct hunk fixes this issue by starting the nested loops at i+1 and j+1.",
