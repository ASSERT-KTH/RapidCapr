                    "content": "Based on the test error, it seems like the current implementation of `compareTo` is returning 0 (meaning the fractions are equal) instead of -1 (meaning the current fraction is smaller than the provided fraction). Therefore, we need to change the implementation to correctly compare the two fractions. One way to do this is to use the cross-multiplication technique to get a common denominator for the two fractions and then compare the numerators. Here is one possible fix:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long)this.denominator * object.numerator;\n    return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\nThis implementation uses `Long.compare()` to compare the values of `nOd` and `dOn`, which are the products of the numerator of the current fraction with the denominator of the provided fraction and vice versa, respectively. By multiplying with longs, we can avoid integer overflow issues.",
