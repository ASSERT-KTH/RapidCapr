The `clone` method should return a copy of the object, but it may be returning a reference to the original object instead. A possible solution could be to implement a deep copy of the object, where all fields and references are properly copied, not just the reference to the original object. \n\nHere is an example implementation of a deep copy `clone` method:\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass implements Cloneable {\n    private int size;\n    private List<Element> elements;\n\n    // constructors, getters, setters, etc.\n\n    // deep copy clone method\n    public MyClass clone() {\n        try {\n            // call Object's clone to create a shallow copy\n            MyClass copy = (MyClass) super.clone();\n\n            // create a new list for the elements\n            List<Element> elementsCopy = new ArrayList<>();\n\n            // deep copy each element and add to the new list\n            for (Element e : elements) {\n                Element eCopy = e.clone();\n                elementsCopy.add(eCopy);\n            }\n\n            // set the new list in the copy\n            copy.setElements(elementsCopy);\n\n            return copy;\n        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {\n            // should never happen since we implement Cloneable\n            throw new InternalError(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a new `ArrayList` for the elements and deep copies each element into the new list. It then sets the new list into the copied object. This way, any changes made to the elements of the copied object will not affect the original object.",
