However, the loop in the original code starts from `n` and decrements by `1` until it finds the first divisor, which does not guarantee that it will be the greatest divisor. \n\nOne way to fix this issue is to start the loop from `n/2` and decrement by `1` until it finds the first divisor, which will be the greatest divisor.
