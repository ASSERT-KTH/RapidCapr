Make sure that the `getTypedPercent()` method is correctly implemented and calculating the percentage as expected.\n2. Double-check the input to the `getTypedPercent()` method and make sure it matches with the test case.\n3. Check if there are any other dependencies or external factors that might be affecting the test result.\n4. Try to add more debug information to the test case to identify the root cause of the issue.\n5. Consider reviewing the test case and the test suite to ensure that they are covering all possible edge cases and scenarios.",
