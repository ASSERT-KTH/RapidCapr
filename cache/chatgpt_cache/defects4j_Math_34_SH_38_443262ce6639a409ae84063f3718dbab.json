This suggests that the `Chromosome` class does not support iteration. One possible fix could be to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` in the `iterator()` method:\n\n```java\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n}\n``` \n\nThis ensures that the test case will pass as expected and signals to the caller that the `Chromosome` class does not support iteration. However, it may not be the most user-friendly behavior in a production setting. An alternative fix could be to return an empty iterator:\n\n```java\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return Collections.<Chromosome>emptyList().iterator();\n}\n```\n\nThis will also make the test case pass while indicating that the `Chromosome` collection is empty.",
