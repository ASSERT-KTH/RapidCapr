One alternative fix line could be:\n```java\nif (str_chars[str_chars.length - 1] == 'y' && result > 0)\n    result -= 1;\n```\nThis line checks if the last character of the input `String` is 'y', and if so, it decrements the `result` variable by 1 as the 'y' should not be counted as a vowel. \n\nNote that this alternative fix assumes that the failing test case has the word ending with a 'y' that is not part of a vowel sound. If the failing test case has a word ending in 'y' that should be counted as a vowel ('sky', 'lazy', etc.), then this alternative fix may not be appropriate.",
