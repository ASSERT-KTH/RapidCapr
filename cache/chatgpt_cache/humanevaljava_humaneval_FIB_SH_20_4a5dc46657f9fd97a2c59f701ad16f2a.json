The infill location can be fixed by the following hunk:\n\n```java\npublic static int fib(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return n;\n    }\n    \n    int[] memo = new int[n + 1];\n    memo[0] = 0;\n    memo[1] = 1;\n    \n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];\n    }\n    \n    return memo[n];\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation stores all the computed Fibonacci numbers in an array `memo`, starting from 0 and 1. Each value `memo[i]` is computed as the sum of the two previous values `memo[i-1]` and `memo[i-2]`. By computing each value only once and storing it in `memo`, we avoid redundant computations and improve the time complexity of the algorithm to O(n).",
