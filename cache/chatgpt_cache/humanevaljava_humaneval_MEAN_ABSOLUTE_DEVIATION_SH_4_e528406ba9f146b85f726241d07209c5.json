So, we need to take the absolute difference of each number from the mean and then find their sum and average them to get the mean absolute deviation. In the original buggy hunk, we need to square the deviation before summing them to find the variance and later taking the square root of it to get the standard deviation, which won't help us in finding the Mean Absolute Deviation. In the first alternative fix hunk, we add the absolute difference between each number and the mean to the deviation sum. In the second alternative fix hunk, we add the deviation between each number and the mean divided by the size of the numbers list, which is equivalent to finding the average deviation.",
