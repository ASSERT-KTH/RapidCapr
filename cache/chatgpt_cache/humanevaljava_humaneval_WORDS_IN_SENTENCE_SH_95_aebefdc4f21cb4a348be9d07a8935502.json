The fix for the compilation error is to move the int flag = 0; declaration outside of the for loop, like this:\n```java\n    public static String words_in_sentence(String sentence) {\n        String result = \"\";\n\n        for (String word : sentence.split(\" \")) {\n            int flag = 0;\n            for (int i = 2; i < word.length(); i += 1){\n                if (word.length() % i == 0) {\n                    flag = 1;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (flag == 0 || word.length() == 2)\n                result += word + \" \";\n        }\n        return result.trim();\n    }\n```\nI hope this fixes the issue.",
