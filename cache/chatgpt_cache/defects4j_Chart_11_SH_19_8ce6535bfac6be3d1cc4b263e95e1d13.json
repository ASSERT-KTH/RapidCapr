Then, the while loop was checking whether `!done` was true and at the same time calling the `currentSegment()` method on `iterator2`. Since `iterator2` was never initialized, it resulted in a `NullPointerException`. \n\nThe correct fix is to initialize `iterator2` with `p2`, which is later used in the while loop to retrieve the segments of both `p1` and `p2` and compare them. The alternative fix hunk resolves this bug in the code.",
