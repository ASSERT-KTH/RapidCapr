We can remove the redundant calls to the `super` constructor with `paint` and `stroke`.\n- We check if `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` are not `null`, and call the corresponding `setOutlinePaint` and `setOutlineStroke` methods.\n- If either `outlinePaint` or `outlineStroke` is `null`, we set the outline paint or stroke to the same value as the main paint or stroke, respectively.",
