The condition should be `(d_int % 2 == 1)`, but it's written as `(d_int % 2 != 1)`:\n\n```java\nif (d_int % 2 != 1 && d_int >= 0) {\n    result += d_int;\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this problem, you can try changing the condition to `(d_int % 2 == 1)` which means add only if `d_int` is odd. Here's the updated hunk:\n\n```java\nif (d_int % 2 == 1 && d_int >= 0) {\n    result += d_int;\n}\n``` \n\nI hope this helps to resolve the issue.",
