As an automated program repair tool, I do not have the complete context of your code, so there might be other issues as well. \n\nHere is an updated solution that should resolve the error:\n\n```java\nboolean inD = d != null && d.length > 0 && d[0] != null && (0 in d[0]);\n```\n\nThis checks if `d` is not null, has a non-zero length and its first element is not null. It also checks if the index `0` is in the first element of `d`, and assigns the result to the `inD` variable.
