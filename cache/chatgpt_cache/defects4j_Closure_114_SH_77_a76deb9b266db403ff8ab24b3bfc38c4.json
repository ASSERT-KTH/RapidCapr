Therefore, an alternative fix hunk is needed.\n\nAfter reading the code and analyzing the test case, it seems that the issue is with the assignment expression in `(fun = function(){ x; })()` being misinterpreted as a function call. The fix could be to check if the parent of `recordNode` is a call expression with `NodeUtil.isCallParent(recordNode)`. If it is, then we record the scope for `recordNode.getParent()`. The correct hunk to replace the removed block would be:\n\n```java\n        } else {\n          // Check if the parent of the record node is a call expression\n          if (NodeUtil.isCallParent(recordNode)) {\n            // If it is, record the scope for the parent of the record node\n            recordDepScope(recordNode.getParent(), ns);\n          } else {\n            recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n          }\n        }\n```\n\nThis should correctly identify the assignment expression and record its scope.",
