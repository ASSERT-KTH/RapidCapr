This condition only holds true when the decimal part of the double is exactly 0.0, which seems unlikely in this case. \n\nTo fix this, we can check if the double value is equivalent to its integer value using the `Math.floor()` function instead. Replace the buggy line with the following code:\n```java\nif (Math.floor(d) == d) {\n```\n\nAdditionally, to get the correct result, `result` needs to be initialized with 0.5 instead of 0 since we are using multiplication. \n\nIt can be fixed by the following hunk:\n```java\n    public static int double_the_difference(double[] lst) {\n        double result = 0.5;\n        for (Double d : lst) {\n            if (Math.floor(d) == d) {\n                int d_int = (int) d;\n                if (d_int % 2 == 1 && d_int >= 0) {\n                    result += (d_int * (d - d_int));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return (int)result;\n    }\n```",
