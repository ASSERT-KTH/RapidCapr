Moreover, there was an off-by-one error in the for loop condition in the search function. To fix this issue, we need to increase the size of the `frq` array by 2. Finally, we need to increment `frq[lst[i]]` instead of `frq[i]` in the `for` loop when counting the frequency of each element in the `lst`.",
