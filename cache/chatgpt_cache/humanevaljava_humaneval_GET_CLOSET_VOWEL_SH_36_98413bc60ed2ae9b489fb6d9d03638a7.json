However, this can lead to cases where the function returns an empty string even if the closest vowel is in fact adjacent to the current character. \n\nTo fix this, we can modify the condition as follows:\n\n```java\nif(!vowels.contains(word.charAt(i + 1)) || !vowels.contains(word.charAt(i - 1)))\n```\n\nThis condition checks if either of the adjacent characters are not vowels.
