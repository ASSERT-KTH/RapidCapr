This suggests that the `iterator()` method in the code is returning an iterator that does not support the `remove()` method.\n\nTo fix this, we can use the `Collections.unmodifiableList()` method to create an unmodifiable view of the list of chromosomes. This ensures that the iterator returned by the method does not support the `remove()` method, as required by the test. Therefore, the following hunk can be used to fix the issue:\n\n```java\nreturn Collections.unmodifiableList(chromosomes).iterator();\n```",
