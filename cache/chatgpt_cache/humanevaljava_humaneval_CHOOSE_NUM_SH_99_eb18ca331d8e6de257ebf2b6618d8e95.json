This is because if `y` is zero, the first condition will evaluate to `false` and the code will proceed to the second condition where `x == y` will also be `false`. Therefore, instead of returning `y - 1`, which will be `-1` in this case, the function should return `-1` as an indication of an error or an invalid input.",
