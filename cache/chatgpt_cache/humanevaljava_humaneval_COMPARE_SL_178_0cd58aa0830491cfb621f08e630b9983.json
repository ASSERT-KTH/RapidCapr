Therefore, a safe solution would be to first check if the divisor is zero before performing the division. Here's one possible correct line:\n\n```java\nif (guess[i] == 0) {\n    result[i] = -1;\n} else {\n    result[i] = Math.floorDiv(game[i], guess[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis line sets the `result[i]` to `-1` if the divisor (`guess[i]`) is zero, and to the result of the division if the divisor is non-zero. This way, we avoid the division by zero error.",
