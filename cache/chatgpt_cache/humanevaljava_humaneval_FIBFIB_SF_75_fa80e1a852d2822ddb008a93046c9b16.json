Based on the error message you provided, it looks like the first element of the Fibonacci sequence is being tested with an expected result of 1. However, the first element of the Fibonacci sequence is actually 0.\n\nHere's the correct code for the `fibfib` function:\n\n```java\npublic static int fibfib(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1)\n        return n;\n    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2);\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly compute the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence given input n.\n\nI hope this resolves the issue.
