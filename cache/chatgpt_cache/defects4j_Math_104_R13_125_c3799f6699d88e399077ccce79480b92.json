Here is the correct line to add at the infill location:\n\n```java\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\n\nThis value of `1e-9` is the standard default value for epsilon in most numerical algorithms that rely on floating-point arithmetic. \n\nBy changing the value of `DEFAULT_EPSILON` from `10e-9` to `1e-9`, it reduces the precision of the epsilon value, which should resolve the unexpected difference between the expected and actual values in the failing test case. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
