Here's the updated solution:\n\nPlease replace the following infill line:\n```\n>>> [ INFILL ] <<<\n```\n\nwith:\n```\nint g = (int) (((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound)) * 255);\n```\n\nAdditionally, you need to include `return new Color(g, g, g);` after the infill line to ensure the method returns a valid color, like below:\n```java\n    public Paint getPaint(double value) {\n        double v = Math.max(value, this.lowerBound);\n        v = Math.min(v, this.upperBound);\n        int g = (int) (((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound)) * 255);\n        return new Color(g, g, g);\n    }\n```\nThis should fix the compilation error and pass the given test case.",
