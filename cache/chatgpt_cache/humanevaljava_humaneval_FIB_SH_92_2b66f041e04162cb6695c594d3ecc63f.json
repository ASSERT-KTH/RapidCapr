If `n` is non-negative, it checks if `n <= 1`, in which case it returns `n`. Otherwise, it recursively calls `fib` on `n-1` and `n-2` and returns their sum. This ensures that the function does not enter an infinite recursion in case a negative value is passed, and also handles the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.",
