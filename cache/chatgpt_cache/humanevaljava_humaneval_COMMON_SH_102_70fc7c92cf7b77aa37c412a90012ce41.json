The issue in the `common` method is that the `common` ArrayList is not initialized before being used to store the common elements between the two input arrays. Therefore, I suggest modifying the infill location with the following code:\n\n```java\nArrayList<Integer> common = new ArrayList<>();\n```\n\nThis initializes the `common` ArrayList before starting the loop to check for common elements between the two arrays. The complete modified code would be:\n\n```java\npublic static int[] common(int[] l1, int[] l2) {\n    ArrayList<Integer> common = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < l1.length; i += 1){\n        for (int j = 0; j < l2.length; j += 1){\n            if (l1[i] == l2[j])\n                common.add(l1[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    int[] result = new int[common.size()];\n    int index = 0;\n    for (Integer c : common) {\n        result[index] = c;\n        index += 1;\n    }\n    Arrays.sort(result);\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis should fix the issue and pass the failing test.",

Another issue in the `common` method is that the `common` ArrayList does not support duplicates, so each common element is added only once. The fix for this is to modify the if statement that adds elements to the `common` ArrayList to check if the element is already present in the ArrayList. I suggest modifying the infill location with the following code:\n\n```java\nArrayList<Integer> common = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (int i = 0; i < l1.length; i += 1){\n    for (int j = 0; j < l2.length; j += 1){\n        if (l1[i] == l2[j] && !common.contains(l1[i]))\n            common.add(l1[i]);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis checks if the current element is present in the `common` ArrayList before adding it to the list. The complete modified `common` method should now look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static int[] common(int[] l1, int[] l2) {\n    ArrayList<Integer> common = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < l1.length; i += 1){\n        for (int j = 0; j < l2.length; j += 1){\n            if (l1[i] == l2[j] && !common.contains(l1[i]))\n                common.add(l1[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    int[] result = new int[common.size()];\n    int index = 0;\n    for (Integer c : common) {\n        result[index] = c;\n        index += 1;\n    }\n    Arrays.sort(result);\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis should fix the issue and pass the failing test.",
