Since the code snippet has a compilation error and I don't have access to the specific code you are talking about, I cannot provide a specific solution without seeing the code.\n\nHowever, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that there is an infinite loop or a very inefficient algorithm causing the program to take a long time to execute. You can try to optimize the algorithm to make it more efficient and avoid timeouts.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details or the code snippet in question, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide a more specific solution.",
