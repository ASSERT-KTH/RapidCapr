Here is the corrected line to replace the infill location in the first code snippet:\n\n```\nreturn doubleValue() * 100;\n```\n\nFor the second code snippet, assuming that the `fit` method's purpose is to fit a model to some data using a guessed parameter, you could try replacing the infill location with:\n\n```\nreturn fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess, new double[]{0});\n```\n\nThis sets a lower bound of 0 for the guessed parameter.
