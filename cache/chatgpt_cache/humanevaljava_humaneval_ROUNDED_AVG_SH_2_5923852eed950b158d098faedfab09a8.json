The correct fix should be as follows:\n```java\n\n            avg_rounded = (int) Math.floor(avg + 0.5);\n``` \n\nThis calculates the nearest integer to the average `avg` by adding 0.5 to it, taking the `floor` of the result, and casting it to an `int`. The `floor` function will round down the value of the integer, which is the correct behavior for rounding in this case. Adding 0.5 to the value of the average ensures that it is rounded to the nearest integer.",
