The loop variable `j` started at 0 instead of starting at `i+1`, and the loop variable `k` started at 0 instead of starting at `j+1`. This caused the current `A[i]` to be compared with all the other values in `A`, including itself, resulting in the wrong output. Starting `j` and `k` at `i+1` and `j+1`, respectively, ensures that we only compare a value with all the values that come after it in the array.",
