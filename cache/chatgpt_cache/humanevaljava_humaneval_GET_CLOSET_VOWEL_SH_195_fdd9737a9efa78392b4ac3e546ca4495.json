After reviewing the code again, it seems like the original buggy code was closer to being correct and that changing the loop starting index from `word.length() - 2` to `word.length() - 1` did not fully address the bug. Here is an updated answer:\n\nThe following code contains a buggy hunk that has been removed.\n```java\n    public static String get_closet_vowel(String word) {\n        if(word.length() < 3) return \"\";\n        ArrayList<Character> vowels = new ArrayList<Character>(Arrays.asList('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'));\n>>> [ INFILL ] <<<\n            if(vowels.contains(word.charAt(i))) {\n                if(!vowels.contains(word.charAt(i + 1)) && !vowels.contains(word.charAt(i - 1))) {\n                    return word.substring(i, i + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return \"\";\n    }\n```\nThis was the original buggy hunk which was removed by the infill location:\n```java\n\n        for(int i = 0; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {\n```\n\nThe code fails on this test:\n```\ntest_get_closet_vowel\n```\non this test line:\n```java\n        org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(\n```\nwith the following test error:\n```\n   EXPECTED:<i> but was:<>\n```\nPlease provide the correct hunk at the infill location.\n\nIt can be fixed by the following hunk:\n```java\n\n        for(int i = 1; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {\n```\n\nThe issue with the original buggy code was that it started the loop from `0`, which will check the first character of `word` and could potentially return the wrong result. By changing the loop to start from index `1`, we skip the first character of `word`. Additionally, the loop should run to `word.length() - 1` instead of `word.length() - 2` to ensure that the second to last character is checked. With these changes, the test should pass.",
