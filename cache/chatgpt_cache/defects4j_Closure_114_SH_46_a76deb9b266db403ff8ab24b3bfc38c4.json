                    "content": "Based on the provided information, it seems like the issue is related to recording dependency scopes for assignments involving function calls. The suggested fixes involve adding a condition to check if the parent of the assignment node is a call node. \n\nAnother possible fix could be to check if the right-hand side of the assignment is a call node, and if it is, exclude it from being associated with the dependency scope of the left-hand side variable. Here's the alternative fix hunk:\n\n```java\n        if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n          // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n          // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.
