It also handles the base cases differently. Instead of calling the function recursively for n-1 and n-2, we use two variables to keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers and compute the next Fibonacci number using those two variables. This avoids the stack overflow issue that can occur with large values of n when using recursion.",
