The buggy hunk contained an infinite loop since the condition was n >= 0, which includes 0 and negative values of n. Also, the multiplication should be performed only for the odd digits, therefore, the correct condition is `(digit % 2 == 1)`. Finally, it should return -1 if no odd digit is found instead of 0, since the product of any number with 0 is 0.",

However, the original implementation returned `0` if there were no odd digits in the number. Therefore, I have changed it back to `0`. The compilation error was caused by a missing semicolon at the end of the `if` statement.",
