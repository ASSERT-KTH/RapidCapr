The original buggy hunk that was removed had an additional call to `recordDepScope()` which was required to fix this issue.\n\nTherefore, the correct hunk to fix this issue is:\n\n```java\n        } else {\n          // The rhs of the assignment is the caller. If it's a function call,\n          // don't associate it with the lhs; instead treat it as an argument.\n          // FYI: this fixes only the specific case where the assignment is the\n          // caller expression, but it could be nested deeper in the caller and\n          // we would still get a bug (which requires a more complex fix).\n          // See testAssignWithCall2 for an example of this.\n          if (recordNode.getParent().isCall()) {\n            recordDepScope(recordNode.getParent(), ns);\n          } else {\n            recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);\n          }\n        }\n```\n\nThis hunk checks if the right-hand side of the assignment is a function call, and if so, it associates it with the parent of the record node instead of with the record node itself.",
