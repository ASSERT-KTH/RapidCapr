Here is the corrected implementation of the `add` method in Java:\n\n```java\npublic static int add(int x, int y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n```\n\nRegarding the `derivative` function, I will assume that it is meant to compute the derivative of a polynomial represented by the given list of coefficients. Here is a corrected implementation of the `derivative` method:\n\n```java\npublic static List<Integer> derivative(List<Integer> xs) {\n    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();\n    \n    for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {\n        result.add(xs.get(i) * i);\n    }\n    \n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation computes the derivative of the polynomial represented by the coefficients in the `xs` list and returns the result as a list of coefficients for the derivative polynomial. Note that the first coefficient is dropped, since it corresponds to the constant term in the original polynomial, which has a derivative of zero.",
