                    "content": "Based on the provided information, it seems that the original hunk of code used `doubleValue()` method to calculate the double values of the numerator and denominator of the fractions being compared, which resulted in precision loss.\n\nOne approach to fix this could be to convert the fractions to a common denominator and then perform the comparison based on the numerators. Here's a possible fix hunk that implements this approach:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long commonDenominator = this.denominator * object.denominator;\n    long thisNumerator = this.numerator * object.denominator;\n    long otherNumerator = object.numerator * this.denominator;\n\n    return Long.compare(thisNumerator, otherNumerator);\n}\n```\n\nThis fix first calculates the least common multiple of the two denominators, which is used as the common denominator for both fractions. Then, it calculates the equivalent numerators for each fraction based on this common denominator.\n\nFinally, it compares the numerators using the `Long.compare()` method, which returns either -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second argument.\n\nNote that this fix hunk assumes that the `numerator` and `denominator` fields of the `Fraction` class are of type `long`. If they are of type `int`, you should replace the `long` declarations with `int`.",
