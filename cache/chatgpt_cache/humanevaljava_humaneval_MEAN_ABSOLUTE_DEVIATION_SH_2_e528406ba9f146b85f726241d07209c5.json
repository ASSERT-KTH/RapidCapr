The original buggy hunk attempted to compute the sum of squared deviations from the mean, which is not the correct approach for computing the mean absolute deviation. The correct approach is to compute the sum of absolute deviations from the mean, which can be done using the `Math.abs` function. Therefore, alternative fix hunk above correctly computes the deviation sum as the sum of absolute deviations and should fix the code.",
