However, I can give you some general tips that might help you fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for any missing opening or closing brackets, braces, or parentheses in your code. A missing curly bracket or parenthesis can cause the \"class, interface, or enum expected\" error.\n\n2. Make sure that you have properly declared all variables and methods in your code. Java requires that all variables and methods be declared within a class or interface. If a variable or method is declared outside of a class or interface, you will get the \"class, interface, or enum expected\" error.\n\n3. Check for any syntax errors in your code, such as misspelled keywords or incorrect capitalization.\n\n4. If your code is divided into multiple files, make sure that all files are included and properly referenced in your main class.\n\nIf you still have trouble fixing the issue, please share the code snippet so that I may help you better.",
