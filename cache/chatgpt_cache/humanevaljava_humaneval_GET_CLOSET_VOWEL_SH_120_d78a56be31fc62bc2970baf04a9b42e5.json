The new implementation stores the closest vowel found in a variable, and compares it to each vowel in the word, updating the closest vowel each time a vowel is closer to the middle of the word than the current closest one.\n\nOnce the iteration through all the vowels is completed, the function checks whether a closest vowel was found and returns it if so, or an empty string otherwise.",

The `if` statement around the loop should have the open brace on the same line as the statement to avoid compile error. In this new hunk, there is no syntax error. \n\nThe code now computes the distance of each vowel character from the center of the word using the `Math.abs()` function and updates the `closest_vowel` and `closest_distance` variables for every vowel closer to the center than the current closest one. Finally, it returns the result as a string using `String.valueOf()`.",
