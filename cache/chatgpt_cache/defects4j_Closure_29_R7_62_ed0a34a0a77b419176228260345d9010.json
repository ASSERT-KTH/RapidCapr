If we encounter any non-assignment statements while processing the references, we immediately return `false`, because we can only inline objects when all the referenced statements are var declarations or simple assignment statements. If we reach the end of the loop and have not seen any non-assignment statements, but we have seen at least one assignment statement, we know we can inline the object and return `true`.",
