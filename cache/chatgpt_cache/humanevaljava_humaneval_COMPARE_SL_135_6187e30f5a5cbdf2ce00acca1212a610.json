Based on the original test failure and assuming that the goal of the `compare` method is to return an array of 1s, 0s and -1s, depending on the comparison of the values in the same index position of the `game` and `guess` arrays, you can try the following code at the infill location:\n```java\n            if (guess[i] == game[i]) {\n                result[i] = 1;\n            } else if (contains(game[i], guess)) {\n                result[i] = -1;\n            } else {\n                result[i] = 0;\n            }\n```\nAnd here is the helper method `contains`:\n```java\n    private static boolean contains(int n, int[] arr) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n            if (arr[i] == n) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n```",
