The formula to calculate the U statistic involves the product of the sample sizes, which can be a very large integer in some cases. The original code used an `int` to store the product, which can overflow when the product exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Therefore, the correct line should use a `long` data type to store the product. Option 1 and option 7 also provide correct fixes, but option 1 is overly restrictive by casting both operands to `long`, while option 7 is equivalent to option 1.",
