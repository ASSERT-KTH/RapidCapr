                    "content": "Based on the error message, it seems that the current implementation returns 0 instead of -1. \n\nTo fix this, we need to update the comparison logic so that it returns -1 when the current fraction is less than the input fraction, 1 when the current fraction is greater than the input fraction, and 0 when they are equal.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by comparing the products of the numerators and denominators. If the product of the current numerator and the input denominator is less than the product of the input numerator and the current denominator, then the current fraction is less than the input fraction, and vice versa. If the products are equal, then the fractions are equal.\n\nHere's one possible fix:\n\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long nOd = this.numerator * (long) object.denominator;\n    long dOn = (long) this.denominator * object.numerator;\n    return Long.compare(nOd, dOn);\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation computes `nOd` as the product of the current numerator and the input denominator, and `dOn` as the product of the current denominator and the input numerator. It then uses `Long.compare` to compare the two products and return -1, 0, or 1 accordingly.",
