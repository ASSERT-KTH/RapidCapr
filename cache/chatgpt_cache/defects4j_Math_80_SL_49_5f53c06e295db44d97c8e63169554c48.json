The reason for subtracting `pingPong` instead of adding it (as in option 2 and 4) is because `pingPong` has already been added to the index in the preceding if-statement, so we need to subtract it again to get the correct index.\n\nOption 1 and 6 are also correct since they calculate the same index but in a slightly different way. Option 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect because they don't take into account the `pingPong` variable which was removed from the original buggy line. Option 7 is also incorrect because it adds `pingPong` twice to the index.",
