The issue is that the `else` block is incorrectly decrementing `pos`, which results in skipping characters in some cases when writing to the output `Writer`. To fix the issue, we only need to remove the line `pos--;` within the `else` block. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```java\npublic final void translate(CharSequence input, Writer out) throws IOException {\n    if (out == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The Writer must not be null\");\n    }\n    if (input == null) {\n        return;\n    }\n    int pos = 0;\n    int len = Character.codePointCount(input, 0, input.length());\n    while (pos < len) {\n        int consumed = translate(input, pos, out);\n        if (consumed == 0) {\n            out.appendCodePoint(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n        } else {\n            // contract with translators is that they have to understand codepoints\n            // and they just took care of a surrogate pair\n            for (int pt = 0; pt < consumed; pt++) {\n                if (pos < len - 2) {\n                    pos += Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n                } else {\n                    pos++;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        pos++;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI hope this fixes the issue.",
