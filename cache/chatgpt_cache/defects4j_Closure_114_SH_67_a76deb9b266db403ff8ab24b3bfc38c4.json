                    "content": "The bug occurs due to an incorrect dependency scope calculation logic. Based on the comments in the code, it seems like the issue occurs when an assignment appears in the init, condition, or iteration part of a `for` loop, and there are multiple assignments in those parts. In that case, the last assignment wins, causing incorrect reference edges between referenced and assigned variables. \n\nThe removed hunk of code was trying to solve the issue by recording the dependency scope for the RHS of the assignment, only when the assignment is the caller expression, and not associating it with the LHS. But this fix is not sufficient, as there could be cases where the assignment is nested further in the caller.\n\nThe correct fix would be to change the dependency scope calculation logic so that it correctly identifies the reference and assignment edges. Without seeing the rest of the code, it's challenging to provide an accurate hunk to fix the problem.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide an alternative fix hunk without further information.",
