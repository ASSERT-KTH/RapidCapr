                    "content": "Thank you for bringing this to my attention. You are correct that my previous suggestion may have introduced a new issue.\n\nIt seems that the infill location you provided is incomplete, making it difficult to determine the exact location of the buggy hunk. However, based on the information provided, it seems likely that the highlighted line `return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg == null? \"null\" : arg.toString());` is the source of the compilation error.\n\nTo address this issue, you can modify the code to use an if-else statement instead of the ternary operator. Here's an example hunk that may work:\n\n```java\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    if (arg == null) {\n        return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(\"null\");\n    } else {\n        return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code checks whether `arg` is null and returns the correct string representation accordingly. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
