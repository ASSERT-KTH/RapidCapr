It starts with the first number, moves on to the second and third numbers to its right, then repeats the process for the rest of the array. If a combination of three numbers adds up to zero, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false after all possible combinations have been tried. This ensures that all possible triplets are checked for the sum being equal to zero, which was missing in the original implementation.",
