If we assume that the two integers have the same number of digits, we could retrieve the last digit by finding the remainder (%) when divided by 10, and then multiply the remainders. This, however, is not enough to multiply the two integers since only the last digits are multiplied.\n\nOne possible solution to properly multiply the two integers would be to use the Long Multiplication method, where we multiply each digit of one number with each digit of the other number and then sum the results.\n\nHere is the corrected hunk:\n\n```java\npublic static int multiply(int a, int b) {\n    int product = 0;\n    int multiplier = 1;\n    while (b > 0) {\n        int digit = b % 10;\n        int partialProduct = 0;\n        int multiplicand = 1;\n        while (a > 0) {\n            int aDigit = a % 10;\n            partialProduct += digit * aDigit * multiplicand;\n            multiplicand *= 10;\n            a /= 10;\n        }\n        product += partialProduct * multiplier;\n        multiplier *= 10;\n        b /= 10;\n        a = Math.abs(a); // converting negative a to positive \n    }\n    return product;\n}\n``` \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or issues.",
