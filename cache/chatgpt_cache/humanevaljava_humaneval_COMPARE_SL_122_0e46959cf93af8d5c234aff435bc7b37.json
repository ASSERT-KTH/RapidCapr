Since the test case is failing for almost the same input, your original solution may not be appropriate. \n\nAnother approach that you can consider is to use the '+' operator for addition. You can replace the infill line with the following line: \n\n```java\n            result[i] = Integer.compare(game[i], guess[i]) == 0 ? 1 : 0;\n```\n\nThis new implementation returns 1 when the elements are the same, and 0 when they are different.
