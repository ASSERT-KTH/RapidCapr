The function `iscude` correctly checks if a number is a perfect cube by using the mathematical formula of finding the cube root and then checking its integer value. The issue seems to be with the input `a` for which the function is being tested. As per the test case given, it is being tested for `-1` which is not a valid input for the `iscude` function as it only checks for positive integers. A simple fix would be to add a check at the beginning of the function to return `false` if the input parameter `a` is less than or equal to 0. Updated code with the fix is shown below:\n```java\n    public static boolean iscude(int a) {\n        if (a <= 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        double root = Math.pow(a, 1./3);\n        BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(root);\n        int round_root = (int) bd.setScale(0, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue();\n\n        return ((int) Math.pow(round_root, 3)) == a;\n    }\n```",
