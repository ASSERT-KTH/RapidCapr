The implementation seems to be returning 0 instead of -1 for the given test case. \n\nOption 1 and 2 in the given list do not seem to be correct as they introduce floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to inaccuracies. Option 3 and 4 seem to be correct, as they use `long` arithmetic to avoid precision issues with floating-point arithmetic.\n\nTherefore, a possible correct hunk to fix the issue would be:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * (long)object.denominator;\nlong dOn = this.denominator * (long)object.numerator;\nreturn (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n```\n\nThis hunk uses `long` arithmetic to compare `numerator/denominator` with `object.numerator/object.denominator`. If their fraction value is less than or greater than the other, then it returns -1 or +1 respectively. Otherwise, if they are equal, it returns 0.",
