Therefore, a possible correct hunk could be:\n\n```java\nlong nOd = this.numerator * object.denominator;\nlong dOn = object.numerator * this.denominator;\n\nif (nOd < dOn) {\n    return -1;\n} else if (nOd > dOn) {\n    return 1;\n} else {\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a formula for comparing two fractions by cross-multiplying their numerators and denominators. The resulting numerator and denominator are then compared. If the former is smaller, the fractions are considered to be in decreasing order; if it is higher, they are in increasing order; and if it is equal to 0, they are equal.\n\nNote that we use `long` to prevent overflow issues when multiplying the numerators and denominators. Also, the use of if-else statements instead of ternary operators enhances code readability.",
