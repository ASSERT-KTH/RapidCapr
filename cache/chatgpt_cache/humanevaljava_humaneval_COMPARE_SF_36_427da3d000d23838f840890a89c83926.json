I will need more information about the test case that is failing to provide a better solution.\n\nHowever, I did notice that the original `compare` function is doing integer division using `Math.floorDiv`, which will always round down to the nearest integer. If you are looking for floating-point division, you should use `double` instead of `int` in the function signature and use `/` instead of `Math.floorDiv`.\n\nHere is an example corrected function that does floating-point division:\n\n```java\npublic static double[] compare(double[] game, double[] guess) {\n    double[] result = new double[game.length];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < game.length; i++) {\n        if (guess[i] == 0) {\n            result[i] = 0;\n        } else {\n            result[i] = game[i] / guess[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nAgain, without more information about the specific test case that is failing, I cannot provide a more targeted solution.",
