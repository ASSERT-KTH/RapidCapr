However, here's a general template of how you can write a function in Java that reads a property file.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.Properties;\n\npublic class PropertyReader {\n\n    private static final String FILE_PATH = \"path/to/property/file.properties\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        readProperty();\n    }\n\n    public static void readProperty() {\n        FileInputStream fileInputStream = null;\n        try {\n            Properties prop = new Properties();\n            fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(FILE_PATH);\n            prop.load(fileInputStream);\n            // Accessing the properties using their keys\n            System.out.println(prop.getProperty(\"key1\"));\n            System.out.println(prop.getProperty(\"key2\"));\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            ex.printStackTrace();\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                if (fileInputStream != null) {\n                    fileInputStream.close();\n                }\n            } catch (IOException ex) {\n                ex.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, we have a `readProperty()` function that reads properties from the property file located at `FILE_PATH`. The `readProperty()` function loads the properties into the `prop` object. After that, it can be accessed using their keys with the `getProperty()` method. In the `finally` block, the `fileInputStream` object is closed to avoid any memory leaks.\n\nI hope this will help you.",

Without seeing the original code or knowing what the `getprop` function is supposed to do, I'm not able to provide the correct implementation. However, here's an example implementation of a `getprop` function in Java that takes a `String` argument and returns a `String` value:\n\n```java\npublic static String getprop(String propertyName) {\n    String propertyValue = \"\";\n\n    try {\n        Properties properties = System.getProperties();\n        propertyValue = properties.getProperty(propertyName);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        System.out.println(\"Error while getting property value: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    return propertyValue;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `System.getProperties()` method to retrieve a `Properties` object that contains system properties, gets the value of the specified property name using the `Properties.getProperty()` method, and returns the value as a `String`. If an error occurs, it prints an error message to the console.",
