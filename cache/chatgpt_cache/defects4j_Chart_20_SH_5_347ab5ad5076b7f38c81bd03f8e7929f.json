The correct implementation is to set `paint` as the main `paint` and `outlinePaint` as the `outlinePaint`. We can achieve this by using the following call:\n\n```java\n        super(paint, stroke, alpha);\n        setOutlinePaint(outlinePaint);\n        setOutlineStroke(outlineStroke);\n        this.value = value;\n```\n\nAdditionally, we set the `outlineStroke` parameter as the outline stroke. Since this hunk was removed, we don't know if it was set correctly in the original implementation. Therefore, we set it using `setOutlineStroke(outlineStroke);`.",
