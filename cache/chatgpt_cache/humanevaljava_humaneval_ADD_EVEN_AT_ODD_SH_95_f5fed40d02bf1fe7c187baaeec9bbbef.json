The correct fix is to iterate over the array with an increment of 2 to access only the elements with odd indices or only the elements with even indices. \n\nIn the alternative fix hunk (2), we start the loop at index 0 and increment by 2 on each iteration, which means we are only accessing even indices of the array. This will add up all the even numbers in the array with even indices.",
