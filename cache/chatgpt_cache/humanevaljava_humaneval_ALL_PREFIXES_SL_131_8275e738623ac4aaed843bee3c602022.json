The first argument specifies the start index and the second argument specifies the end index (exclusive).\n- The original buggy line adds a substring of the original string starting from the index `i + 1` to the end of the string. This means that the first character of the original string is not included in the result.\n- The alternative fix line removes the `+ 1` from the original line, which means that the first character of the original string is included in the result.",
