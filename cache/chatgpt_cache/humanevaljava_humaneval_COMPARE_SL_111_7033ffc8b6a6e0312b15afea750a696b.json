It's hard to provide a specific fix without knowing the context of the code and the requirements, but I will do my best to provide a solution based on the error message.\n\nFor the first code example, the test error shows that the expected result is 3 but the actual result is 5. This means that the add function is incorrectly adding the two input arguments. Therefore, the fix is to replace the infill location with the following code:\n\n```java\n        return x + y;\n```\n\nFor the second code example, the test error shows that the expected result for the first element in the arrays is 1 but the actual result is 0. This means that the compare function is incorrectly comparing the two input arrays. Therefore, the fix is to replace the infill location with the following code:\n\n```java\n            if (game[i] == guess[i]) {\n                result[i] = 1;\n            } else {\n                result[i] = 0;\n            }\n```\n\nThis code sets the result array to 1 if the two elements in the input arrays are equal, and to 0 if they are not equal.",

Without access to the full code and context, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. \n\nHowever, a possible solution is to check if any of the input arrays have a zero at the same index and set the corresponding index of `result` to `0` if that is the case. Otherwise, you can check if the elements in `game` and `guess` are equal and set `result` to `1` if they are. Here is the possible code replacement for the infill location:\n\n```java\nif (guess[i] == 0 || game[i] == 0 || guess[i] != game[i]) {\n    result[i] = 0;\n} else {\n    result[i] = 1;\n}\n```\n\nThis code first checks if either of the input arrays have a zero at the same index. If so, it sets the index of `result` to `0`. If not, it checks if the elements in `game` and `guess` are equal and sets `result` to `1` if that is the case.",
