Since I am not able to see the entire codebase and the tests, I cannot pinpoint the exact problem. However, here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Make sure that the `createFunction` method in the test creates a function that returns a number. The error message suggests that the test expected a number but got something else.\n\n2. Check if there are any other missing return statements in the code that could cause this error. Make sure that all paths in all methods return a value.\n\n3. Consider reviewing the logic of `computeFollowNode` to ensure that it correctly handles all cases of transferring control to a \"symbolic return\" node.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please let me know.",

Since adding a return statement at the end of the method did not fix the issue, the problem must be elsewhere in the code.\n\nBased on the test failure message, it appears that the original code is not returning the expected result, which is causing the missing return statement error. Therefore, the correct infill line would be to add a return statement that returns the expected result. Without more information, I cannot determine the exact return value expected for the test.\n\nHowever, to fix this issue properly, I would need to analyze the code more thoroughly, understand the requirements and expectations of the methods and tests, and potentially debug the code to identify the root cause of the problem.",
