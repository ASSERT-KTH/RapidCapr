Without more context, I can only provide a general solution.\n\nHowever, one possible corrected implementation of the `truncate_number` function could be as follows:\n\n```java\npublic static double truncate_number(double number) {\n    if (number >= 0) {\n        return Math.floor(number);\n    } else {\n        return Math.ceil(number);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis implementation should correctly handle positive and negative numbers as well as return the truncated result for both.\n\nPlease let me know if this fixes the original test failure or if more information is needed to correctly implement the function.",
