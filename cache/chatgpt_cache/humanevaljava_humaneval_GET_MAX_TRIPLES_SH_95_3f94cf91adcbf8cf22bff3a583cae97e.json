This will avoid counting the same pair of numbers again, as well as correctly reducing the number of iterations on the inner loop. By changing the iteration count on the inner loop, it eliminates the possibility of index out of bounds errors - which could have been caused by the original value of `n-1` being included in the loop. Finally, it correctly counts the number of triples where the sum of three numbers is divisible by three, thus ensuring that the test case will pass.",
