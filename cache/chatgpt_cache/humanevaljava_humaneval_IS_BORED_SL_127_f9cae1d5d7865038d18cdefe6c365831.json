However, to provide a possible solution, you could try adding a check for the case sensitivity of the first letter in the sentence. Here is one way to do it:\n\n```java\n    public static int is_bored(String S) {\n        String[] sentences = S.split(\"\\\\.|\\\\?|!\");\n        int result = 0;\n        for (String sentence : sentences) {\n            if (sentence.length() >= 2 && sentence.substring(0, 2).equalsIgnoreCase(\"I \"))\n                result += 1;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n```\n\nThis updated code ignores the case of the first letter in the sentence while checking if it starts with the \"I \" substring. This may help fix the test case.",
