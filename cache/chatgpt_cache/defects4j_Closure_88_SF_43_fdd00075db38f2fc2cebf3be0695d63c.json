The fixed implementation handles these cases by keeping track of whether the variable is \"maybe live\" or not during recursive traversal of the AST. This information is then used to determine if the variable is \"maybe live\" based on its use in child nodes. If a `READ` or `KILL` is found in a child node, then that result is returned to the parent call immediately. If there are no `READ`s or `KILL`s amongst the child nodes, and at least one child returned `MAYBE_LIVE`, then the parent call should also return `MAYBE_LIVE`. Otherwise, if there are no child `READ`s or `KILL`s and no `MAYBE_LIVE`s, then the variable is considered to be `DEAD`.",
