Based on the lack of information about the test failure, it is difficult for me to provide a definitive fix without further context. However, a possible fix for the issue could be to modify the `isAssignedOnceInLifetime` method to count the number of assignments to a variable across all basic blocks and return false if the count is greater than 1. Here is the proposed hunk:\n\n```java\n/**\n * @return Whether the variable is only assigned a value once for its\n *     lifetime.\n */\nboolean isAssignedOnceInLifetime() {\n    Reference ref = getOneAndOnlyAssignment();\n    if (ref == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Count the total number of assignments to the variable across all basic blocks\n    int assignmentCount = 0;\n    for (Reference r : references) {\n        if (r.getName().equals(ref.getName()) && r.isAssignment()) {\n            assignmentCount++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return assignmentCount <= 1;\n}\n```\n\nPlease let me know if this fixes the test failure.
