Since we are getting a division by zero error, we need to handle this error case more carefully.\n\nHere is a revised hunk that should handle the error case and return -1 for any index where `guess[i]` is 0:\n```java\n\n            if (guess[i] == 0) {\n                result[i] = -1;\n            } else if (game[i] % guess[i] != 0) {\n                result[i] = -2;\n            } else {\n                result[i] = game[i] / guess[i];\n            }\n```\nIf `guess[i]` is 0, we set `result[i]` to -1. If not, and `game[i]` is not divisible by `guess[i]`, we set `result[i]` to -2. If `game[i]` is divisible by `guess[i]`, we perform the division and store the result in `result[i]`.\n\nWith this hunk, we handle both the case of division by zero and the case where `game[i]` is not divisible by `guess[i]`.",
