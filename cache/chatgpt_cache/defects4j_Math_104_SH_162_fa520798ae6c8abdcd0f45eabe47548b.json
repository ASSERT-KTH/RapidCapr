The code block that requires the hunk is not available in the context of this conversation, so I cannot provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, I can suggest that you check if there are any missing or extra brackets, semicolons, or other syntax errors in the code surrounding the hunk. A common cause of the \"class, interface, or enum expected\" error is a syntax error in the code. Please double check the code for any such errors and provide more context or the full code if you need further assistance.",
