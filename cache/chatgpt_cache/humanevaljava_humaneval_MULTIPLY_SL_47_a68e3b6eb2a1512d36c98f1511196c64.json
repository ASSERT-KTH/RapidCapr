The following line can fix the issue:\n\n```java\n        return a * b;\n``` \n\nHowever, for the `multiply` function to work with large numbers, we need to implement a more efficient multiplication algorithm. Here is one possible implementation using the Karatsuba algorithm:\n\n```java\npublic static int multiply(int a, int b) {\n    if (a < 10 || b < 10) {\n        return a * b;\n    }\n\n    int m = Math.max(String.valueOf(a).length(), String.valueOf(b).length());\n    m = (m / 2) + (m % 2);\n\n    int x = a / (int) Math.pow(10, m);\n    int y = a % (int) Math.pow(10, m);\n    int w = b / (int) Math.pow(10, m);\n    int z = b % (int) Math.pow(10, m);\n\n    int r1 = multiply(x, w);\n    int r2 = multiply(y, z);\n    int r3 = multiply(x + y, w + z);\n\n    return (int) (r1 * Math.pow(10, (2 * m)) + (r3 - r1 - r2) * Math.pow(10, m) + r2);\n}\n``` \n\nPlease note that you also need to import the `java.lang.Math` class for this implementation.",
