Since the test failure relates to type inference, I suspect that the bug is caused by the generated code having an incorrect type annotation. Based on the limited information provided, I am unable to give a specific line of code to fix the issue. However, here are some possible suggestions:\n\n1. Check that the external library files used in the code are up-to-date and correctly annotated, as the type error might have been caused by incorrect or outdated externs.\n2. You could try using a more precise type annotation for the faulty code block, if possible.\n3. Check whether any type inference flags need adjusting in the build system that generates the code.\n4. If none of the above solutions work, verify whether the error is reproducible by running the test a few times, and if it is, consider providing more information or looking for other potential sources of the error.",
