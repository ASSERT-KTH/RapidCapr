This will lead to incorrect results because a number cannot be paired with itself to give zero. Therefore, in both the fixes provided, the inner loop starts from `i+1` or `i`, which ensures that the current element is not paired with itself and the elements before it have already been paired with it. The first fix (`j=i+1`) ignores the current element and starts checking from the next element, while the second fix (`j=i`) includes the current element in the search for pairs.",
