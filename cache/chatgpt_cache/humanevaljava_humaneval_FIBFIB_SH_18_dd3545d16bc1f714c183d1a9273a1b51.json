Firstly, the if statement for `n==1` returns 0, which is incorrect, as the Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1. Secondly, the method lacks a base case for `n==2`, which would have returned 1, but was erroneously not included. Lastly, for n>2, there is a recursive call with `n-3`, which is incorrect because Fibonacci series is obtained adding the two previous fibonacci numbers. I added a base case for `n==2`, where it returns 1, to fix the first two issues. For the third issue, I changed the recursive function calls to `fibfib(n-1)+fibfib(n-2)` which will correctly solve the fibonacci series.",
