It appears that the original test failure is due to the implementation of the `split_words` method not correctly counting the number of words in the input string that start with a capital letter.\n\nTo fix this issue and pass the failing test case, we can modify the infill hunk as follows:\n\n```java\nif(Character.isLetter(curr) && Character.isUpperCase(curr) && (i == 0 || !Character.isLetter(txt.charAt(i - 1)))) {\n    count++;\n}\n```\n\nThis will increment the `count` variable only if the current character is a capital letter and is the first character of a new word. By checking the previous character, we can determine if the current character starts a new word or not.",
