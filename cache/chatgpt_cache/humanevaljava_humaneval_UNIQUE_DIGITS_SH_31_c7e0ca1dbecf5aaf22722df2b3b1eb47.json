This means that if any digit is even, it will not be added to `res`. The alternative fix hunk modifies the conditional statement to check if the current digit is even. If it is, then `all_odd` is set to `false` and the while loop is exited with the `break` statement. This fixes the issue where odd numbers that contain at least one even digit were being excluded from `res`.",
