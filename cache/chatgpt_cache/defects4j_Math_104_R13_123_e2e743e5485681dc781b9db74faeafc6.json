Here is the corrected line that should be placed at the infill location:\n```java\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\nThe issue was the use of `10e-9` instead of `1e-9`. The exponent in `10e-9` should be negative to represent a very small value, but the `e` usage treats it as a positive exponent, resulting in a value of `1000000000` instead of `0.000000001`.
