However, I can recommend some potential solutions to investigate further:\n\n1. Debug the `getWeek()` method to determine why it is returning the wrong value. It could be a problem with the `Week` constructor, or it could be a problem with the `getWeek()` method itself.\n\n2. Consider adding some validation to the `Week` constructor to ensure that the input values are correct. This could prevent bugs like this from occurring.\n\n3. If possible, try running the `Week` constructor and `getWeek()` method with different dates and time zones to see if the bug is specific to certain inputs.\n\nOnce the cause of the bug is identified, a more appropriate fix hunk can be generated.",
