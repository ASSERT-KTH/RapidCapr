Here's a modified version of the function to fix the issue:\n\n```java\nprivate static Set<Locale> cAvailableLocaleSet = new HashSet<>();\n\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    initializeAvailableLocaleSet();\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n\nprivate static void initializeAvailableLocaleSet() {\n    if (cAvailableLocaleSet.isEmpty()) {\n        for (Locale locale : Locale.getAvailableLocales()) {\n            cAvailableLocaleSet.add(locale);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRegarding the second code snippet, it appears that there is nothing in the code block.
