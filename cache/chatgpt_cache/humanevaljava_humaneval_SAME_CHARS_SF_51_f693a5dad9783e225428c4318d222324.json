However, the prompt is looking for a function that checks if the two strings have the same characters, regardless of the order. We can achieve this by creating a histogram of character frequencies for each string and comparing them.\n\nHere is the corrected implementation:\n```java\npublic static boolean same_chars(String s0, String s1) {\n    if (s0.length() != s1.length()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int[] counts0 = new int[256];\n    int[] counts1 = new int[256];\n\n    for (char c : s0.toCharArray()) {\n        counts0[c]++;\n    }\n\n    for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {\n        counts1[c]++;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < counts0.length; i++) {\n        if (counts0[i] != counts1[i]) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThis should correctly pass the failing test case you provided.",

We iterate through each character in both strings and increment the count for that character in s0 and decrement the count for that character in s1. At the end of the loop, we check if all the counts in the array are zeros, indicating that both strings have the same count of each character.
