Thank you for bringing this to my attention.\n\nBased on the original buggy hunk and the test error message, it seems that the division by zero issue is causing the test to fail. To fix this, we can add a check to ensure that the guess array does not contain a zero value before performing division operation. If a zero value is detected, we can skip that index and set the result for that index to -1. Here's the corrected hunk:\n\n```java\n        for (int i = 0; i < game.length; i += 1) {\n            if (guess[i] == 0) {\n                result[i] = -1;\n            } else {\n                result[i] = Math.floorDiv(game[i], guess[i]);\n            }\n        }\n``` \n\nThis will calculate division only for non-zero indexes of the guess array and return -1 for indexes with zero value, resolving the division by zero issue.",
