However, given that the test timed out after 600 seconds, it's likely that the code is inefficient or has an infinite loop. \n\nI would suggest analyzing the code to determine if there are any performance bottlenecks or infinite loops, and address those issues. Additionally, it could be helpful to break the code into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and simplify debugging.",
