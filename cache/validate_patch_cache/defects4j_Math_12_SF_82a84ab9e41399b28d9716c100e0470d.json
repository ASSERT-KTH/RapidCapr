    "patch": "I'm sorry that the previous solution didn't work as well. Here is an updated implementation of the `normalize` method that should fix the issue:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        sum += distribution[i];\n    }\n\n    if (sum != 0) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n            normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation initializes a new double array `normalized` and iterates through the input array `distribution`, summing up its elements to obtain the total sum. If the sum is not 0, it then iterates through the array again, dividing each element by the sum and storing the result in the corresponding index of the `normalized` array. Finally, the `normalized` array is returned.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.",
