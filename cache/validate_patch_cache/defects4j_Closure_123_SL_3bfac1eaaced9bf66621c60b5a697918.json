Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the issue is not related to the infill location. \n\nWithout the full code or more context, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the error. However, the error message \"illegal start of type\" usually occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as a missing semicolon or curly brace.\n\nPlease provide me with the full code or more context, and the line number where this error is occurring. This will help me provide a more accurate and appropriate solution.",
