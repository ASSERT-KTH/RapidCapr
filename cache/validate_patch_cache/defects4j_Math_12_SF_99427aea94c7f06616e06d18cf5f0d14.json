    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect fixes. Without the actual code and more context, it's hard for me to say what could be causing the test timeout issue. However, here are a few general tips for handling test timeouts:\n\n1. Make sure the tests are properly scoped. Each test should be individually testing a specific behavior or feature of the code. If a test is doing too much, or if there are too many tests running at once, it can lead to timeouts.\n\n2. Consider using mock objects. If the tests are doing too much work or relying on external dependencies, using mock objects can help simplify and speed up the tests.\n\n3. Check the environment. If the code is being tested on a shared server or test environment, it's possible that other processes or tests could be causing the timeout. Consider running the tests on a dedicated environment or machine to rule out this possibility.\n\n4. Optimize the code. If the code itself is slow or inefficient, it can cause the tests to timeout. Consider using profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.\n\nIf you could provide the actual code and error messages, I would be happy to help you with a more specific fix.",
