    "patch": "Based on the given information, it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `Week` constructor is and what caused the failure of the `testConstructor` test. Therefore, we cannot suggest a specific fix line. However, we can provide some possible steps to help diagnose the issue and suggest a fix:\n\n1. Check the `getWeek()` method to understand how the week number is calculated and how it relates to the `timezone` parameter. This will help us understand how the `Week` constructor should be called.\n\n2. Check the `time` and `zone` parameters passed to the `Week` constructor in the failing test. This will help us understand whether they are correct or not and suggest a fix accordingly.\n\n3. Check if the `getWeek()` method returns the expected result for a given time and timezone. If it does not, then there could be a bug in this method, and fixing the `Week` constructor may not be enough.\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of the problem, we can suggest a specific fix line.\n\nNote: It is possible that the buggy line that was removed was not the root cause of the failure, and the actual bug may be somewhere else in the code. Therefore, it is important to understand the problem thoroughly before making any changes.",
