    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working and for any inconvenience caused by the timeout error. Without seeing the actual code, it's hard to provide an accurate solution.\n\nA test timing out after 600 seconds means that the test is taking too long to complete. This can happen due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The code contains an infinite loop.\n2. The algorithm used in the code is too slow.\n3. The input size of the test is too big, causing the algorithm to take too long to complete.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can try one (or more) of the following steps:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm used in the code. Look for inefficiencies in the code that can be improved. You can use a profiler to find the bottlenecks in the code.\n2. Break down the input size of the test into smaller sizes and test the algorithm on each of these smaller inputs. This will help identify the actual input size that is causing the issue.\n3. Add a timeout to the test case to prevent it from taking too long. You can do this by changing the timeout parameter of your test case.\n\nIf you can provide the code, I can take a closer look and provide an appropriate solution.",
