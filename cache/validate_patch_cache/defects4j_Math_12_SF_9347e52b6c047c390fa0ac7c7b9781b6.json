    "patch": "I am sorry that my previous attempts could not resolve the issue. As per your latest response, it seems that the code is taking too long and is timing out. Here are some potential strategies to address this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for inefficiencies and redundant computations. Simplify the code where possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce the size of input data: If feasible, test the code on smaller test cases to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nAs I cannot see the code, I apologize for not being able to provide a precise solution. Please try to implement these strategies one-by-one or all to see if they resolve the issue.",
