    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The timeout error is occurring because the test is taking too long to execute. \n\nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult for me to identify the exact issue. However, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm - Look for any parts of the algorithm that can be improved or simplified. This could include reducing the number of operations or restructuring the code to be more efficient.\n\n2. Use a profiler - A profiler can help to identify the specific parts of the code that are taking the most time to execute. Once identified, these parts can be optimized.\n\n3. Use appropriate data structures - Make sure that the data structures being used are appropriate for the task at hand and are being used efficiently.\n\n4. Use multithreading - If it is appropriate for the task at hand, consider using multiple threads to perform calculations simultaneously. This can significantly improve performance.\n\n5. Simplify the test case - If the test is taking too long to execute, consider whether it can be simplified. For example, you could reduce the size of the input data or limit the number of iterations.\n\nI hope these tips help. Without seeing the code and more information on what exactly you want to do, I cannot provide a more specific solution to the issue.",
