    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the actual code that is causing the issue, it is difficult for me to provide a precise solution. However, here are some general tips that may help with this issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that you are not stuck in an infinite loop. This can happen if your loop condition is not correct or if your loop does not have a proper exit condition.\n\n2. Optimize your code: If your code is taking too long to execute, look for ways to optimize it. This can include reducing the number of iterations in your loops or using more efficient algorithms.\n\n3. Increase the test timeout: If your test is timing out, you can try increasing the test timeout value to give your code more time to execute. However, this is not a recommended solution, as it can mask underlying issues with your code.\n\n4. Divide and Conquer approach: Split the test into smaller tests. If a test is timing out, it may be because it is doing too much work. You may be able to split your test into smaller tests that are more focused and run faster.",
