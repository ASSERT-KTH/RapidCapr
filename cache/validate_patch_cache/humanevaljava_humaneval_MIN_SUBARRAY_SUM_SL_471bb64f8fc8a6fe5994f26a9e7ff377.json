    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. Here is the correct version:\n\n```\ns += num;\nmax_sum = Math.max(max_sum, s);\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe problem with the original code was that `max_sum` was only being updated if `s` was positive, which is incorrect. The corrected version updates `max_sum` by taking the maximum of the current `max_sum` and the current `s`. The corrected code correctly calculates the maximum subarray sum seen so far.\n\nRegarding the compilation error you encountered, it's because there was a missing semicolon at the end of the `s += num` line. I apologize for the oversight. The corrected code has the semicolon in place.",
