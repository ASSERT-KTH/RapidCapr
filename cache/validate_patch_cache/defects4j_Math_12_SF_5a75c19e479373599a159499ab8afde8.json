Without the code to work with, I can only provide general guidance.\n\nIt appears that the test is timing out, meaning that the function is taking too long to execute. This could be due to an infinite loop or a very large input size.\n\nTo address this, you could try optimizing the function to improve its performance. Consider using more efficient algorithms and data structures, or reducing unnecessary computations. You may also want to check for any potential infinite loops.\n\nIf optimizing the function does not resolve the issue, you may need to increase the timeout limit for the test, or consider splitting the input into smaller parts to reduce the workload.",
