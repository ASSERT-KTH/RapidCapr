    "patch": "Apologies for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the correct solution:\n \n```\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\n\nThe issue with the original code was that the value of `DEFAULT_EPSILON` (1.0 \u00d7 10^-9) was originally assigned incorrectly as 10.0 \u00d7 10^-9. This caused a failure in the test which was looking for a high degree of precision. The corrected value of DEFAULT_EPSILON (1.0 \u00d7 10^-9) resolves this issue and should make the test pass.",
