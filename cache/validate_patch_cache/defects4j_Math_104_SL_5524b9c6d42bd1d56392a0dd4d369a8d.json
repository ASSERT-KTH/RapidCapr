    "patch": "I apologize for any confusion caused earlier. Considering the error message you provided, it seems that there is a syntax error in your code that is causing the compilation error.\n\nWithout seeing the entire code file and the context of the infill location, it's hard to provide an accurate fix. However, I can suggest checking the following:\n\n- Ensure that all opening and closing braces ({ }) are properly formatted and match up.\n- Check that all semicolons (;) are in the correct places in the code.\n- Ensure that all statements and variable declarations are inside a class, interface, or enum.\n\nIf you are still facing issues, please provide more context or the full code file. I will try my best to assist you further in finding and fixing the issue.",
