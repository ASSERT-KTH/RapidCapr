    "patch": "If the code is timing out even after optimizing the algorithm and/or increasing the timeout value, it's possible that there are underlying issues or inefficiencies in the code that need to be addressed.\n\nWithout access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, some possible approaches to fixing the function include:\n\n1. Simplifying the algorithm to reduce the number of computations and loops.\n\n2. Finding more efficient data structures or algorithms to perform necessary operations.\n\n3. Refactoring the code to improve code quality and readability.\n\n4. Parallelizing the code to take advantage of multiple cores or processors.\n\n5. Running the code on a faster and more powerful machine.\n\n6. Using profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the code.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
