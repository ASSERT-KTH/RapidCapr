    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like the timeout error is occurring due to the size or complexity of the test case. Without further information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general fixes that may help improve the performance of the function:\n\n1. Check for redundant calculations - If there are any calculations that are being repeated multiple times in the function, it may be helpful to store the result in a variable and reuse it later.\n\n2. Optimize loops - If the function has any loops, make sure the condition to terminate the loop is efficient. Additionally, if there are any nested loops in the function, try to reduce the number of iterations.\n\n3. Use efficient data structures - If the function uses data structures such as arrays or lists, make sure to choose the appropriate data structure that provides the best performance for the particular use case.\n\n4. Profile the function - It may be helpful to use a profiling tool to identify the bottleneck in the function. This can help to optimize the performance of the function by targeting the specific area causing the issue.\n\nWithout the complete function and information about the use case, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
