    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code or the specific error message, it's difficult for me to suggest a solution. However, a timeout error usually indicates that the code is taking too long to execute and might be stuck in an infinite loop. \n\nThere are a few things you could try to fix this issue:\n\n1. Check if there is an infinite loop in the code and fix it.\n\n2. Optimize the code to reduce its runtime complexity (e.g., by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure).\n\n3. If running the test on a slower machine, consider increasing the timeout limit.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details, I'll be happy to help further.",
