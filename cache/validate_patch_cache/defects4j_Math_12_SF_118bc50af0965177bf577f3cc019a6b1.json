Check for infinite loops: If the code is stuck in an infinite loop or recursing indefinitely, it can cause the test to time out. You can add some debugging statements to the code or use a debugger to step through the code to identify any such problems.\n\n3. Optimize the code: If the code takes a long time to run because of inefficient algorithms or resource-intensive operations, you can try optimizing the code to make it more efficient. This may involve rethinking the algorithm or using more efficient data structures, among other things.\n\nI hope this helps, please let me know if you need any further assistance",
