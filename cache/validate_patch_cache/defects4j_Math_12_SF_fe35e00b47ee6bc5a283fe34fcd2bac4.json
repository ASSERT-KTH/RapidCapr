    "patch": "It's difficult to provide a correct function without knowing the details of the code and test cases. But, one possibility for the timeout issue could be the algorithmic complexity of the code. If the code has a high algorithmic complexity, it can take a long time to complete the execution and cause the timeout error. \n\nHere are a few possible solutions to try:\n\n1. Optimize the code by reducing the algorithmic complexity.\n2. Split the test cases into smaller units and run them separately to avoid timeouts.\n3. Increase the timeout limit for the test cases.\n4. Check if the test environment has enough resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) to run the test.\n\nIt may be helpful to analyze the specific details of the code and test cases to determine the root cause of the issue.",
