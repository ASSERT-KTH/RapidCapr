    "patch": "It seems that increasing the timeout value did not resolve the issue. A compilation error is different from a timing out error. \n\nWithout access to the full code and context, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips:\n\n- Check if there are any syntax errors in the code. Look for missing semicolons or parentheses, wrongly spelled variables, or incorrect method signatures.\n\n- Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are imported correctly.\n\n- Try running the code in a local environment to see if any issues arise.\n\n- Double-check that all test cases are set up correctly and are using the appropriate input values.\n\n- Make sure the function signature matches the one provided in the question prompt. \n\nIf none of these solutions work, it may be necessary to provide more information on the issue or seek assistance from a colleague or mentor.",
