    "patch": "Without seeing the original code, it is difficult to provide a specific fix for the removed buggy hunk. However, here are some general approaches that might be helpful:\n\n1. Look at the test error message to identify what the expected behavior is. Then, try to understand what is causing the code to fail the test. Based on that knowledge, you can come up with a fix for the buggy hunk.\n\n2. Try to reproduce the error locally, and use a debugger to step through the code and identify the problematic line. Once you have a better understanding of what's causing the error, you can come up with a fix for the buggy hunk.\n\n3. If there are other similar functions or code blocks that are working correctly, you can compare them to the buggy code and try to identify the differences. This may help you isolate the issue and come up with a fix for the buggy hunk.",
