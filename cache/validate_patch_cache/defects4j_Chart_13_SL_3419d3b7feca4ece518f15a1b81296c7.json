One possible fix could be to modify the infill line to include `Math.max(0, constraint.getWidth() - w[3])` as the upper bound to ensure it is not smaller than the lower bound. With this in mind, the fix line could be:\n```\nnew Range(0.0, Math.max(0, constraint.getWidth() - w[3])),\n```\nThis ensures that the upper bound of the `Range` will always be greater than or equal to the lower bound.",
