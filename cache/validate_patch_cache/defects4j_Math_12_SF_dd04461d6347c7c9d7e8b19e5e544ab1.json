Without seeing the code, I cannot accurately assess the issue and provide a correct solution. \n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is exceeding the time limit of 600 seconds. This may indicate a performance issue in your code. To resolve this issue, you can try optimizing your code to make it more efficient. \n\nAdditionally, it is possible that the time limit for the test can be increased if it is necessary to run for longer than 600 seconds. You can check the specifications for the test to see if an increased time limit is allowed. \n\nIf you are able to provide the code causing the error, I will be happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
