    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the previous fixed version did not completely resolve the issue.\n\nWithout seeing the original code snippet and test case, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it appears that the test case is taking too long to run and is timing out.\n\nOne possible solution is to optimize the algorithm or function being tested to improve its performance and reduce the runtime of the test case. Alternatively, you could adjust the timeout period for the test case if that is an option.\n\nPlease provide the original code snippet and test case so that I can provide a more accurate solution to the issue.",
