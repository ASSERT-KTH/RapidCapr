    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect fix. Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the underlying issue. However, the timeout error suggests that the function may have an issue with time complexity or an infinite loop.\n\nI suggest looking at the code for any loops or recursive calls that may cause an infinite loop. Additionally, check if any data structures are used incorrectly or inefficiently, especially within loops.\n\nTo assist with the debugging process, we can try adding print statements or using a debugging tool such as a debugger within an IDE.\n\nOnce the root cause of the timeout error is identified, we can then work on providing a corrected function.",
