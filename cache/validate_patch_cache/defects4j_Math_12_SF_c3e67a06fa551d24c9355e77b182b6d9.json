    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation, I can only provide a general strategy to resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Analyze the algorithm's time complexity and look for inefficiencies or areas where it can be improved. Implement any necessary changes to improve its performance.\n\n2. Reduce input size: If possible, reduce the input size to decrease the algorithm's workload. This could involve limiting the number of iterations in a loop, processing only a subset of the data, or reducing the size of the input data.\n\n3. Concurrency: Consider implementing concurrency to execute tasks in parallel and decrease the overall execution time. This can be especially useful for CPU-intensive operations.\n\n4. Caching: If appropriate, cache the results of expensive operations to avoid recomputing them on future calls.\n\n5. Profile the code: Use a profiler to identify which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute. Use this information to target specific areas for optimization.\n\nOnce specific issues are identified and addressed, the function should pass without exceeding the timeout. I hope this helps. If you can provide me with more information or code snippet, I could assist you further.",
