    "patch": "I apologize for the previous unsuccessful attempts. Without the actual code, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, the error message suggests that the test is taking too long to execute, and it is timing out after 600 seconds.\n\nTo fix this issue, you may need to optimize the algorithm used in the function to reduce the runtime. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Analyze the algorithm to identify any slow or inefficient components and optimize them. This could include using more efficient data structures, reducing the number of calculations, or replacing slow loops with faster ones.\n\n2. Implement a caching mechanism to store intermediate results and prevent recalculation of the same values repeatedly.\n\n3. Parallelize the algorithm to take advantage of multi-threading and reduce the runtime.\n\n4. If possible, reduce the complexity of the algorithm by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nAlternatively, you could try increasing the timeout limit of the test, or running the test on a machine with higher processing power.\n\nAgain, without access to the actual code, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you can provide more information, I can try to give a more accurate answer.",
