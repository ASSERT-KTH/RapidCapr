    "patch": "I apologize for any confusion caused. Without seeing the full context of the code, it's difficult for me to provide the exact location of the infill line.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that there might be a syntax error elsewhere in the code file. It's possible that this error is preventing the code from even compiling, regardless of the correctness of the line that I suggested.\n\nPlease inspect the code file carefully, look for any syntax errors or missing class/interface/enum declarations, and fix them as needed. Once the code compiles without errors, you can retry running the test and checking whether the suggested change to the `epsilon` value resolves the issue.\n\nIf you're still having trouble after reviewing the code, feel free to provide more details or share more of the code file so I can better assist you.",
