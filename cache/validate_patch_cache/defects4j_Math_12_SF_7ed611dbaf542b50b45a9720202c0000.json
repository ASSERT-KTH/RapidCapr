    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the code and additional information, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function. Here are some general suggestions that may help:\n\n1. Check if there are infinite loops or recursion in the code that is causing it to run indefinitely and eventually time out.\n2. Ensure that the code is optimized for performance, especially in cases where it is handling large datasets or doing complex operations.\n3. Consider using parallel processing or asynchronous programming where appropriate to improve performance.\n4. Increase the timeout limit if it is set too low to allow the program to complete its execution.\n5. Check if there are any memory leaks in the code that are causing it to consume too much memory and eventually time out.\n\nIf you can provide additional information or the code, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide more specific suggestions.",
