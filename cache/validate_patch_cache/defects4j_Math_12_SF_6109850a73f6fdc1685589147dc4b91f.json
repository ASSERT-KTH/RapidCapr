    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working. The timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute, so we need to optimize it. Without seeing the actual code, it's difficult to suggest specific changes. However, here are some general tips to optimize the code:\n\n1. Avoid doing expensive calculations inside loops. If possible, move them outside the loop or pre-compute them.\n\n2. Use efficient data structures. For example, use arrays instead of lists if the size is fixed.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary object creation. Instead of creating new objects, try reusing existing ones.\n\n4. Use caching to avoid recomputing the same result multiple times.\n\n5. Use parallelism if possible. Split the work into multiple threads to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\nIf you can provide me with the actual code, I can analyze it and suggest specific changes to optimize it.",
