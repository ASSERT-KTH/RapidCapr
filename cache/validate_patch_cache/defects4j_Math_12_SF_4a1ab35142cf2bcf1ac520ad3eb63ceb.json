    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake. Without knowing the exact issue in the code, I am unable to provide an appropriate solution for it.\n\nHowever, I suggest trying the following steps to resolve the compilation error:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops in the code and fix them if found.\n2. Check the memory usage of the program and increase the heap size if needed.\n3. Check if any external dependency is causing the issue and update it to the latest version.\n4. Optimize the code, if possible, to reduce the execution time.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide me with the original code and more context about the problem, so that I can assist you further.",
