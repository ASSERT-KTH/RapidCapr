    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the original code or knowing more details about the error message, I cannot provide a immediate solution. Here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check if the function has an infinite loop, or if it is stuck in a loop that takes a long time to complete.\n\n2. Check if the function is using an inefficient algorithm. Consider optimizing the algorithm or using a different, more efficient one.\n\n3. Check if the function needs to handle large inputs differently. You may need to adjust your code to handle large inputs.\n\n4. Check if the function is properly terminating. If it is meant to terminate at some point, make sure that it does so.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about the error message and the code that you are working with.",
