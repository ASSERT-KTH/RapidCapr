    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. The `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error might be caused by an infinite loop or a long-running algorithm.\n\nWithout seeing the code, I can suggest the following general debugging steps:\n- Check for any infinite loops in the code\n- Optimize any long-running algorithms\n- Split the code into smaller functions and test each part separately\n- Increase the timeout value in the test suite if necessary\n\nIf you could provide the code for further analysis, I could provide more specific suggestions for resolving the issue.",
