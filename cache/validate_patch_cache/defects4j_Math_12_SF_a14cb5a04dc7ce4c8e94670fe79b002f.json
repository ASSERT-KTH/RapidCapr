    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. The `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error message indicates that the test is taking too long to complete and ultimately times out after 10 minutes.\n\nWithout seeing the code implementation, I cannot provide a specific solution, but here are some common strategies for optimizing code with long runtimes:\n\n1. Reduce the size of input: If the input data to the function or test case is too large, it may be causing the delay. You can check to see if there is a way to reduce the input size or partition it into smaller subsets.\n\n2. Check for bottlenecks: Try to identify any parts of the code that are taking the longest to run. You may be able to achieve significant speedup by optimizing these parts.\n\n3. Use more efficient data structures: Depending on the specific data being manipulated, using more efficient data structures such as hash tables or binary search trees can greatly reduce the runtime.\n\n4. Parallelization: Depending on the type of problem you are solving, you may be able to break the problem into smaller subproblems that can be computed in parallel. Consider using parallelization frameworks such as OpenMP to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\n5. Memoization: Memoization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can be very effective when dealing with recursive functions.\n\nIf you are unable to fix the issue with the previous strategies, I would recommend trying to increase the timeout limit of the test or running the test on a machine with more powerful hardware.\n\nIf you need more help, please provide me with specific details on the implementation and test so that I can provide a more specific solution.",
