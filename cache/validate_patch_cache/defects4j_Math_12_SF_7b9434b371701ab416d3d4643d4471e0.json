    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. Here's another implementation that should work and not have any timeouts:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] dist = distribution.clone();\n    while (m > 0) {\n        if (m % 2 == 1) {\n            dist = multiply(dist, distribution, n);\n        }\n        distribution = multiply(distribution, distribution, n);\n        m /= 2;\n    }\n    return dist;\n}\n\nprivate static double[] multiply(double[] a, double[] b, int n) {\n    double[] c = new double[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            c[(i + j) % n] += a[i] * b[j];\n        }\n    }\n    return c;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation takes advantage of the fact that if we square the given distribution, we get the probability distribution for two rounds. If we raise the squared distribution to the power of two again, we get the probability distribution for four rounds. We use this property to fast-forward the distribution calculation.\n\nIn `distributionClone` method, we first make a clone of the given distribution `dist`, and then we repeatedly square `distribution` and multiply it with `dist` if the binary representation of `m` has a bit set at a particular position. We can easily square the distribution by calling `multiply(distribution, distribution, n)`. This `multiply` method multiplies two probability distributions by brute force, and the resulting distribution is then returned for further multiplication.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
