    "patch": "I apologize for the error in the previous fix. It's difficult to provide a correct function without seeing the code, however, the timeout error may indicate that the function is taking too long to run. Here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. Optimize the function to reduce its runtime complexity\n2. Increase the timeout value in the test runner\n3. Divide the function into smaller, more manageable sub-functions that can be called separately.\n\nIf you can provide the relevant code snippet, I can provide a more targeted solution to the problem.",
