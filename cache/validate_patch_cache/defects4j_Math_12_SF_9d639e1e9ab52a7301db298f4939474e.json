However, without the code it's not possible for me to provide a new fix. \n\nThe timeout error could be caused by a number of things such as inefficient algorithm or slow running tests. It's possible that the original code was not designed to handle a large input size or a specific edge case. You may want to review the code or the test cases to determine the root cause of the timeout error. \n\nIf you can provide the code, I can analyze it and give you a more specific and accurate solution.",
