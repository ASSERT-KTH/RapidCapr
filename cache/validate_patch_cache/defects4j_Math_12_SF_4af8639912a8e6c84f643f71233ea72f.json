    "patch": "Without additional information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer. However, here are some possible approaches to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider breaking down the problematic test into smaller, more focused tests that can be run more quickly and efficiently. This can help identify the specific part of the code that is causing the error.\n2. Review the code thoroughly, and consider refactoring or optimizing any sections that seem to be particularly slow or complex.\n3. Check that all dependencies and resources required by the test are properly configured and available.\n4. Consider running the test on a different environment or platform to isolate any potential platform-specific issues.\n5. Check for any potential concurrency issues that may be causing the test to take longer than expected, and try to optimize the code to address these issues.\n6. If the problem persists, consider seeking help from other developers or the original code authors to identify the root cause of the issue and find an appropriate fix.",
