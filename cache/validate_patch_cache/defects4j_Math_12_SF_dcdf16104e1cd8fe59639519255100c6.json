    "patch": "I apologize for that. The timeout error indicates that the program is taking too long to execute and is likely stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult for me to determine the root cause of the issue and provide a correct function for you.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips to help diagnose and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops in the code, and make sure all loops have a clear exit condition.\n2. Make sure the program is not blocked on I/O. If the program is waiting for user input or performing a long-running I/O operation, it may appear to be stuck in an infinite loop.\n3. Use a debugger or logging statements to track the execution of the program and identify any problem areas.\n4. Optimize the code where applicable, especially if you notice a particularly slow or inefficient portion of the program.\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide more information and I'll do my best to assist you further.",
