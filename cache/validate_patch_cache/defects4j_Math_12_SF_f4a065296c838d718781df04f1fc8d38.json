    "patch": "If the code is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that there is an infinite loop or a very long running process in the code. Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or long-running processes in the code. Look for loops that run for a large number of iterations or any processes that take a long time to complete.\n\n2. Look for any unnecessary computations or operations that could be removed or optimized.\n\n3. Review the data structures being used in the code and consider if any can be replaced with more efficient alternatives.\n\n4. Run the code with a profiler or debugger to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.\n\n5. Consider dividing the input data into smaller portions and processing them in chunks to reduce the memory usage and reduce processing time.\n\n6. Increase the timeout value of the test, but this should be used with caution as it may mask deeper issues with the code.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
