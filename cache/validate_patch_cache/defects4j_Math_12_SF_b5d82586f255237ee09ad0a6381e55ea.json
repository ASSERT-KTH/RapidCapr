    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general strategies that may help address a timeout error:\n\n1. Reduce the size of the input: If the code takes too long to run, you can try reducing the size or complexity of the input to see if that speeds up the processing time. This might involve testing with smaller input data sets or limiting the range of input values in some way.\n\n2. Optimize the algorithm: Look for ways to make the algorithm more efficient. This could include reducing the number of loops or computations, optimizing data structures, or finding more efficient ways to perform necessary operations.\n\n3. Use caching: If the algorithm involves repeating computations on the same input data, consider using caching or memoization to store the results of previous computations and avoid duplicating work.\n\n4. Use parallelization: Some algorithms can be made faster by breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks and performing them in parallel. Consider using threading or multiprocessing to parallelize the algorithm and speed up processing times.\n\n5. Increase the timeout value: If none of the above strategies work, you might consider increasing the timeout value for the test. However, be aware that this can mask deeper issues with the code and may not be a viable long-term solution.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
