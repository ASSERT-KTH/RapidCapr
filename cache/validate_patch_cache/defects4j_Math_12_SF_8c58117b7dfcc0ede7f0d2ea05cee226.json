    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous attempt. Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, here's my attempt at resolving the issue:\n\n```\npublic class Distribution {\n    \n    private final double[] probabilities;\n    private final Random random = new Random();\n\n    public Distribution(double[] probabilities) {\n        this.probabilities = probabilities;\n    }\n\n    public int sample() {\n        double prob = random.nextDouble();\n        double cumulativeProb = 0.0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < probabilities.length; i++) {\n            cumulativeProb += probabilities[i];\n            if (prob <= cumulativeProb) {\n                return i;\n            }\n        }\n        return probabilities.length - 1;\n    }\n    \n    public double[] getProbabilities() {\n        return probabilities;\n    }\n    \n    public Distribution clone() {\n        return new Distribution(Arrays.copyOf(probabilities, probabilities.length));\n    }\n    \n}\n```\n\nI have made a few changes to the previous implementation. Primarily, I have created a new instance of the `Random` class within the `Distribution` class, which ensures that every time a new instance of `Distribution` is created, it has its own separate instance of `Random`.\n\nAdditionally, I have removed the `synchronized` keyword from the `sample()` method, as it is not necessary to synchronize the method if each instance of `Distribution` has its own separate instance of `Random`.\n\nFinally, I have added a `clone()` method to the `Distribution` class that creates a new instance of `Distribution` with a copy of the probabilities array. This ensures that the original probabilities array is not modified when the new instance is modified.\n\nPlease let me know if this resolves the issue, or if any further changes are required.",
