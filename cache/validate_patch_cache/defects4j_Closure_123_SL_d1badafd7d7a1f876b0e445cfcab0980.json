    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous responses. Based on the latest compilation error message, it seems that the issue is not related to the import statement. Instead, there might be a syntax error in the code.\n\nWithout access to the full source code, it is difficult for me to pinpoint the exact issue. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the error is related to a problem with the syntax or structure of the code.\n\nTherefore, I suggest reviewing the code near the removed buggy line to ensure that it is properly structured and that there are no syntax errors. Additionally, please ensure that any necessary import statements are included at the top of your code file. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide more details on the nature of the code and the error message so I can provide further assistance.",
