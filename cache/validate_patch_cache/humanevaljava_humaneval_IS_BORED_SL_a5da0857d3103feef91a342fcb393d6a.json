Let's review the issue again: the original buggy code failed due to the following test failure:\n\n```\n   TEST_IS_BORED.test_4:39 expected:<1> but was:<2>\n```\n\nThe purpose of the `is_bored` function is to count the number of sentences where the phrase \"I \" (with a space) appears at least twice. The previous infill line should achieve this functionality correctly. \n\nTherefore, we need to investigate why the fix did not solve the original test failure. Can you provide more context about the failing test? What is the input string for test case 4, and what is the expected output? This will help us identify the issue and provide a more accurate fix.",
