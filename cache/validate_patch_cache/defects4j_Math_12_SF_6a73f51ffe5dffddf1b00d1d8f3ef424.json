The error message you provided suggests that there might be an infinite loop or extremely slow execution time in your code. \nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult to provide an exact solution, but here are some general tips that might help:\n\n1. Make sure there are no infinite loops in the code.\n2. If there are any recursive functions, make sure they have a base case that terminates the recursion.\n3. Optimize the code for performance, if possible.\n\nIt might also be helpful to run the code with a debugger to see where it is spending most of its time and identify any possible bottlenecks.",
