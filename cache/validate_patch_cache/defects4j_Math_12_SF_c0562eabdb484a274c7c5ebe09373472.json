Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the problem. \n\nHere are some possible strategies that could help improve the performance of the code: \n\n1. Check for any nested loops and see if there is a way to reduce the number of iterations.\n2. Consider using more efficient data structures, such as arrays or hash tables, instead of lists or maps.\n3. Use memoization, where applicable, to avoid repeated calculations.\n4. Profile the code to identify any bottlenecks and optimize those sections.\n\nIf you can provide more details or the code in question, I can provide more specific guidance.",
