    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working and for the timeout error. Without the full context and code, it is difficult for me to provide a working solution. However, I can suggest some general strategies that may help to resolve the error:\n\n1. Check the code for any infinite loops. \n2. Look for any operations that have a higher time complexity than necessary and try to optimize them. \n3. Consider breaking the function down into smaller, more manageable functions. \n4. Consider using a profiler to identify any areas where the code is spending a significant amount of time.\n\nOnce you have attempted these strategies, please provide the updated code and full test suite, and I will be happy to try to provide a working solution.",
