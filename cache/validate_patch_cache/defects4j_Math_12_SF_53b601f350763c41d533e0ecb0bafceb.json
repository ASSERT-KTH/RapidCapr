    "patch": "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's possible that the original code has more issues than just the one you identified. Without access to the code and additional information about the tests that are failing, it's difficult for me to provide the correct function. However, I can give you some general tips for resolving timed-out tests:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Tests may time out if there is an infinite loop in the code. Ensure that any loops have a clear termination condition.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If the code is taking too long to run, try to optimize it. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit: Some test frameworks allow you to increase the timeout limit for individual tests or for all tests. If this is an option, try increasing the limit to see if the test passes.\n\n4. Use parallelization: If the test suite is large, consider using parallelization to run tests on different threads or machines.\n\n5. Debug the code: If none of the above solutions work, you may need to debug the code to identify the root cause of the issue. Use logging and debugging tools to pinpoint where the code is getting stuck.",
