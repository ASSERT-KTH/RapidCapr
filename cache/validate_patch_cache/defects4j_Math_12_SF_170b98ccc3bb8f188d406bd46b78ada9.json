    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It's difficult to provide a solution without seeing the code itself, but here's a general approach you can take to debug the issue:\n\n1. Check the test file to see if the test cases are implemented correctly.\n2. Check the function under test to ensure that it is doing what it is intended to do.\n3. Look for any infinite loops or long-running operations that could be causing the issue.\n4. If the issue persists, try to isolate the issue to a specific part of the code and debug it using print statements or a debugger.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details or the code itself, I will be more than happy to help you fix the issue.",
