To correctly handle surrogate pairs, we can modify the infill line to the following:\n```\npos += Character.isHighSurrogate(input.charAt(pos)) ? 2 : 1;\n```\nThis line checks if the current code unit is a high surrogate, and if it is, increments `pos` by 2 to skip over the next low surrogate as well. This should ensure correct handling of surrogate pairs and fix the failing test.",
