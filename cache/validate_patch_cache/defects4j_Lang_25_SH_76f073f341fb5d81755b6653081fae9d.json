    "patch": "I apologize for the error in the previous response. Since I do not have access to the complete code, it is difficult for me to provide the exact fix for the issue. However, based on the error message you provided, there might be an issue with the usage of the \"`=`\" operator. It is possible that there is an attempt to use the \"`=`\" operator with a non-existent operand, which is causing the error.\n\nTo fix this error, make sure that all instances of the \"`=`\" operator are used with valid operands. Also, double-check that all variables are properly declared and initialized before they are used in the program.",
