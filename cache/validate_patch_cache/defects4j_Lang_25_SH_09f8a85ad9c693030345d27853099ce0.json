    "patch": "I apologize for my previous response. Without the actual code and context, it is difficult to provide a specific solution to the compilation error you are facing. However, I can offer some general advice.\n\n- Check for any syntax errors in the code near the location where you have made the change.\n- Make sure that all variables used in the code have been declared and initialized correctly.\n- Check if the operator being used in the code is valid for the type of data being manipulated.\n- Ensure that all import statements are correctly included, especially if you are using external libraries.\n\nI hope this helps in resolving the compilation error. If you could provide more information about the code and context, I would be happy to assist you further.",
