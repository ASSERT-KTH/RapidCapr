It is difficult to provide a correct solution without the code to work with.\n\nTo fix the issue, I would recommend looking into optimizing the code and possibly using a more efficient algorithm to avoid the time-out error. Additionally, you could try running the test on a faster machine or increasing the time-out limit to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information or the code that is causing the time-out error, I may be able to provide more specific guidance on how to fix the issue.",
