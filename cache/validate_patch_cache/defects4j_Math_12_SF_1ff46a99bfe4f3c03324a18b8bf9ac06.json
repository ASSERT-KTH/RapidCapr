    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions. Since the previous solutions didn't work, it suggests that the problem is related to the larger dataset. The following implementation should work more efficiently for the larger dataset.\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double max = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double d : distribution) {\n        sum += d;\n        if (d > max) {\n            max = d;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (max == 0) {\n        return new double[distribution.length];\n    }\n\n    double scaleFactor = max * distribution.length / sum;\n    return Arrays.stream(distribution).map(d -> d * scaleFactor).toArray();\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation starts by finding the maximum value in the array. If the maximum value is 0, then it returns an array of zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a scale factor using the maximum value, the length of the input array, and the sum of the elements in the array. Finally, it scales each element in the array by the scale factor and returns the normalized array.\n\nI hope this implementation works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
