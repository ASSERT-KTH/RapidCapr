Based on the error message you provided, the issue might not be in the line containing the infill location. \n\nThe original buggy line that was removed should not affect the compilation, since it is a valid line of code. Therefore, the issue must be in another part of the program. \n\nCould you please provide more information, such as the full error message and the code surrounding the infill location? This would allow me to give more targeted and accurate assistance.",
