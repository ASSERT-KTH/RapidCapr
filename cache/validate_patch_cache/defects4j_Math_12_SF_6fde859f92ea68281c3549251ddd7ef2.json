Without seeing the code, it's difficult for me to provide a solution. \n\nFor the timeout issue, it's possible that the code contains an infinite loop or other performance bottleneck. To fix this, you could try optimizing the code or breaking the code down into smaller, more manageable functions. \n\nIf you provide me with the code, I may be able to offer further assistance.",
