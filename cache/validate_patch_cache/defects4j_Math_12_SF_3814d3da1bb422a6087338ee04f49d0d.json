Without seeing the code or the exact error message, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, since the test case is timing out, it's possible that the code is not performing efficiently and is taking too long to execute. I would recommend analyzing the code for any inefficient algorithms or operations that could be causing the time out.\n\nIf you could provide more information or the code itself, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide more specific guidance.",
