    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without additional information about the code, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the timeout error. It is possible that the function is simply taking too long to execute due to the complexity of the problem being solved.\n\nHere are a few general steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:\n\n1. Review the code: Check the algorithm being used and see if there are any opportunities to optimize it or reduce the execution time. Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms to improve performance.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the code is processing large amounts of data, try to reduce the input size. This can help identify any issues with the algorithm or implementation that may become more apparent with smaller data.\n\n3. Use profiling tools: Profiling tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks in your code. Use a profiling tool to see where the code is spending the most time and try to optimize those areas.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit: If none of the above steps yield a solution, you can try increasing the timeout limit. However, this is generally not recommended as it only masks the underlying performance issues and does not solve the problem.\n\nAgain, without seeing the specific code, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
