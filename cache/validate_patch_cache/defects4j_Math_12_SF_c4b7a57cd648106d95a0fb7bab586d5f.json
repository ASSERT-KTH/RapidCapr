    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the function is still not working. It seems that the function may be taking too long to execute and the test is timing out. Without knowing the implementation of the function and the input parameters that are causing the timeout, it's hard to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general recommendations:\n\n- Review the implementation of the function and see if there are any inefficiencies that can be improved.\n- It may be helpful to run the function with smaller inputs to see if it works correctly and in a timely manner.\n- Run debugging tools such as a profiler to determine which parts of the function are taking the most time and optimize those sections.\n- Consider breaking up the function into smaller, more manageable chunks if possible. \n\nIf you could provide the implementation of the function and more information about the input parameters and expected output, I can try to provide more specific recommendations.",
