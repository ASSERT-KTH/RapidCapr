In this case, you may want to check if the `jsdocParser` has a way to handle or ignore unknown types. If not, you may have to update the JSDoc annotations in your code to remove the unknown type or provide a known type.\n\nWithout seeing the details of your code, it's difficult for me to suggest a specific fix. However, you may want to try commenting out the line that triggers the unknown type annotation in the JSDoc and see if the test passes. If so, then you can try updating the JSDoc annotation to use a known type or update your code to handle the unknown type. \n\nIf you're still having trouble, feel free to share more information about your code and the specific JSDoc annotation that's causing the issue.",
