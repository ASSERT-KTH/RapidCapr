    "patch": "I apologize for the issue you encountered with the previous implementation. Since the error message indicates a timeout rather than a compilation error, it could be that the normalization function is taking too long to execute or getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an alternative implementation of the `normalize` function that uses a more straightforward approach:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double d : distribution) {\n        sum += d;\n    }\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return new double[distribution.length];\n    }\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation iterates over the elements of the input array to sum them up, checks if the sum is zero, creates a new array to hold the normalized values, and then iterates over the input array again to compute the normalized values and store them in the output array.\n\nI hope this implementation works for you. If you still encounter issues, please let me know and I will try to help further.",
