    "patch": "I apologize for my previous incorrect response and any confusion it may have caused. Based on the error message you've provided, it appears that the issue is not related to the `Context` variable, but rather with the surrounding code.\n\nTo fix the \"illegal start of type\" error, there is likely a syntax error earlier in the code that is preventing the compiler from properly recognizing the type you are trying to declare. You may want to double-check the syntax of the code preceding the missing line of code.\n\nWithout seeing the full context of the code, it's difficult to determine the exact line of code that needs to be added or fixed. If you could provide more information about the larger context of the code or the specific error message, I may be able to give more specific guidance.",
