This latest implementation should work properly.\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[][][] dp = new double[m + 1][n][n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        dp[0][i][i] = 1.0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                for (int l = 0; l < n; l++) {\n                    dp[i][j][(k + l) % n] += dp[i - 1][j][k] * distribution[l] / n;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    double[] ans = new double[n];\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            ans[j] += dp[m][i][j] / n;\n        }\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation uses dynamic programming to calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of balls in each box after `m` iterations. The `dp` array stores the probability of having `j` balls in the `i`-th box at the end of the `k`-th iteration, i.e., `dp[k][i][j]`. The base case is `dp[0][i][i] = 1.0`, as each box starts with one ball.\n\nThe `dp` array is calculated in a bottom-up manner using the following recurrence relation: `dp[k][i][(j + l) % n] += dp[k - 1][i][j] * distribution[l] / n`, where `j` is the number of balls in the `i`-th box at the end of the `k-1`-th iteration, `l` is the number of balls added to the `i`-th box at the `k`-th iteration, and `distribution[l] / n` is the probability of adding a ball to the `i`-th box at the `k`-th iteration.\n\nFinally, we calculate the final probability by summing over all the boxes and iterations, and then returning the average distribution of balls across all of the boxes.\n\nI hope this implementation works well for you. Let me know if you have any further issues.",
