Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Try optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough.\n2. Consider using threads to parallelize portions of your code that are taking too long to run.\n3. Check for any infinite loops, recursion depth issues, or long-running system calls in your code.\n4. Increase the timeout value for the test to run, if possible.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
