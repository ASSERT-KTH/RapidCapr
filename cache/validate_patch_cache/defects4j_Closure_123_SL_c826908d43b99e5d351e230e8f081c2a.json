    "patch": "It's difficult to determine the correct line without the full context of the code and the error message. However, based on the error message, it seems like the bug may be related to the `rhsContext` variable not being set properly. This variable may be needed to correctly parse the expected output for the test case. Therefore, a possible fix may involve setting `rhsContext` to a different value that allows for proper parsing of the expected output. However, without more information it is difficult to provide an exact fix.",
