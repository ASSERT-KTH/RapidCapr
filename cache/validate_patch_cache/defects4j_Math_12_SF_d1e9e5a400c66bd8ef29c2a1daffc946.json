We also make use of dynamic programming to avoid recomputing values.\n\nWe start by computing the base case where we have performed only one trial, and it can either succeed with probability p[0] or fail with probability 1 - p[0], so clone[0] = p[0].\n\nThen, for each i, we compute the distribution of the number of successes in the first i trials. We iterate from 0 to i (inclusive) to consider all possible number of successes and compute the probability of obtaining exactly j successes.\n\nFor each j, we then compute the probability of obtaining the remaining i-j failures, and we add up the product of the two probabilities multiplied by the corresponding cloned distribution value (from the previous loop iteration, when we considered i-1 trials and not i).\n\nFinally, we store the resulting sum in clone[i] and repeat the process for i+1.\n\nBy doing so, we avoid recomputing the probabilities of success and failure for each i and j, and we stop computing the product when it becomes too small (using the cutoff value of 1e-6). The resulting time complexity of this solution is O(np), where n is the number of trials and p is the length of the probability array. This complexity should be reasonable and should not time out.",
