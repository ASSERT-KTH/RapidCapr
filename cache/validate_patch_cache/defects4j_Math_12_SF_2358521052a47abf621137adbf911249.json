    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incomplete solutions. As the test is still timing out, it is likely that the function is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized. Here are a few suggestions to optimize the function:\n\n1. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the distribution, such as dynamic programming or memoization.\n2. Avoid unnecessary calculations and use caching to reuse results of previous computations.\n3. Limit the size of the input array, if possible, to reduce the time complexity of the calculation.\n4. Parallelize the computation by dividing the input array into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel.\n\nWithout access to the source code or more information on the context of the test, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. If you can provide more information, I would be glad to provide more specific suggestions.",
