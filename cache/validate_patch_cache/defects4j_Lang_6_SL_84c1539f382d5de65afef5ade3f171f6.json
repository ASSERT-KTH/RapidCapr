    "patch": "BUG DESCRIPTION:\nThe bug is caused by improper handling of surrogate pairs in the `translate` method. When `Character.codePointAt` is called on a surrogate pair, it returns a supplementary character which requires two `char` values in the `CharSequence` to represent. However, the buggy line only takes into account the first `char` value of the surrogate pair and increments `pos` by only 1, causing the index to go out of bounds when the next call to `codePointAt` is made.\n\nCODE FIX:\n```\npos += consumed;\n```",
