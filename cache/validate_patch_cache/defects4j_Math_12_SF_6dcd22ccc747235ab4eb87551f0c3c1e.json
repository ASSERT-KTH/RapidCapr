Without access to the code, it's difficult to provide a proper solution.\n\nHowever, given the timeout error message, it's possible that the function is taking too long to execute and needs optimization. One approach could be to profile the function to identify the bottleneck and optimize it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, you could try increasing the timeout value to see if that resolves the issue.",
