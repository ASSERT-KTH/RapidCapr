Please provide the code and test suite so that I can give you a more accurate solution regarding the issue. \n\nWithout that information, it would be difficult to provide an accurate solution to the problem. However, please make sure that the code does not have any infinite loops and there are no blocking calls in the code that may cause the test to time out. You could also try increasing the time limit for the test to see if that resolves the issue.",
