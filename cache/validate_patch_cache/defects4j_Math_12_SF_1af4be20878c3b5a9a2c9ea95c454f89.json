    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code snippet and further context, I cannot provide a precise solution. However, since the error message mentions that the test timed out, it could be due to a performance issue in the code. It's possible that the input size or complexity of the code is causing it to take too long to execute.\n\nOne possible solution could be to optimize the code for better performance. This could involve using more efficient algorithms or data structures, or finding ways to reduce the amount of computation needed.\n\nAnother solution could be to break up the code into smaller, more manageable functions. This could make it easier to debug and optimize individual parts of the code.\n\nWithout more information about the code and the context in which it is used, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
