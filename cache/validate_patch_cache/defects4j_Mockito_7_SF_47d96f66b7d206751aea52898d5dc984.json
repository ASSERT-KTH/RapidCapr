The root cause of the issue is that Mockito is using a raw extraction of generic types (which is not supported) and thus throwing the exception.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try upgrading your version of Mockito to a version that supports deep stubbing of generic types. Versions 3.4.0 and above support deep stubbing of generic types. You can try upgrading your version of Mockito to see if it fixes the issue.\n\nIf upgrading is not an option, you can also try changing your test code to use a different mocking library, or you can try mocking the generic types manually rather than relying on Mockito to do it for you.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused, and I hope this information is helpful.",
