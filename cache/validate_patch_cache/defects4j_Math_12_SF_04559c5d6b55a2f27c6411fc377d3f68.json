    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Based on the timeout error you mentioned, it's possible that the code is still not efficient or effective enough to pass the test case.\n\nWithout access to the original code and full context of the problem, it is difficult for me to suggest a solution that is guaranteed to pass all test cases. However, here are some general tips that you may find useful:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops and ensure that the algorithm is efficient enough to handle the size of inputs expected by the test cases.\n\n2. Check for off-by-one errors. Pay attention to the boundaries of arrays, loops, and other data structures.\n\n3. Ensure that the logic of the code is correct. Review your understanding of the problem statement and identify possible edge cases that may not have been considered.\n\n4. Consider using standard libraries and pre-built functions to make the code more concise and efficient.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful and give you a starting point to investigate and improve your code.",
