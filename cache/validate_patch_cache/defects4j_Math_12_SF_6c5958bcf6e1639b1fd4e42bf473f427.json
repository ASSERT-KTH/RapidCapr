    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that didn't work for you.\n\nFor the new timeout issue, it seems that the test case is taking too long to execute, and therefore the test case is timing out after 600 seconds.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to optimize the code further. You can try the following:\n\n1. Check if your code has any nested loops that might be causing the test to time out.\n2. Try switching to a more efficient algorithm if you are using an inefficient one.\n3. Optimize any I/O operations in your code. If you are reading or writing from the disk frequently, it can slow down your program.\n4. If all else fails, try increasing the timeout for your test case further.\n\nWithout the actual code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution, but hopefully, these general tips will help you optimize your code and resolve the timeout issue.",
