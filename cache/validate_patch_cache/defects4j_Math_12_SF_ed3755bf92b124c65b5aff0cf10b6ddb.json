It is difficult to provide a correct solution without more context and information about the code and test.\n\nHowever, a possible solution is to optimize the code or test to run faster. This can be achieved through various techniques such as:\n\n- Avoiding unnecessary computation or loops\n- Reducing the size of input data\n- Parallelizing the code or test\n- Caching results to avoid redundant computation\n\nAlternatively, increasing the timeout value of the test may also solve the issue. However, this is not recommended if the test is already taking an unreasonably long time to run, as it can hide potential performance issues in the code.",
