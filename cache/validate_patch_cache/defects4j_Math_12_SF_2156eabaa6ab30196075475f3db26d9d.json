    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that my previous suggestion did not work. Unfortunately, without seeing the code and the specific test cases that are timing out, it is difficult for me to provide a more accurate solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips for addressing timeouts in test cases:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure your code isn't stuck in an infinite loop. Verify that all your while loops and for loops are exiting properly.\n\n2. Check for resource exhaustion: Your code may be running out of memory or other system resources. Try to identify and address any resource leaks.\n\n3. Reduce input sizes: If your code is timing out on large input sizes, try reducing the size of the input to see if that helps. You can also try optimizing your code to handle large inputs more efficiently.\n\n4. Optimize code: Check if there are any parts of your code that could be optimized. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps you in resolving the issue and you will be able to fix your code successfully.",
