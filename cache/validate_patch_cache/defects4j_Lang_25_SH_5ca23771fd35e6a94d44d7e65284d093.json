    "patch": "Apologies for the confusion. Without any details about the code, I am unable to provide an accurate fix for the issue. \n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems like there is an issue with an equals sign (=) being used as an operand in an expression where it is not appropriate to use it. \n\nPlease check the specific line where the error is occurring and examine the expression to ensure that there are no issues with the equals sign. It may be helpful to review the operator precedence rules in Java to ensure that all operators are being used correctly in the expression. \n\nIf you're still having trouble finding the root cause of the issue, please provide more details about the code and the exact location where the error is occurring, and I'll be happy to provide assistance.",
