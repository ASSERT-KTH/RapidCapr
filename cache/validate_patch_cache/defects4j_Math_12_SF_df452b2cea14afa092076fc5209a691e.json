    "patch": "I apologize for the earlier solutions not working as expected. Here's another implementation that should work and will not result in a timeout:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] current = new double[n];\n    double[] next = new double[n];\n    current[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                next[(j + k) % n] += current[j] * distribution[k];\n            }\n        }\n        double[] tmp = current;\n        current = next;\n        next = tmp;\n        Arrays.fill(next, 0.0);\n    }\n    return current;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two arrays `current` and `next` to keep track of the probability distribution in the current round and the next round, respectively. We start with `current` having probability 1 in box 0 and 0 elsewhere. In each round, we iterate through all the boxes, and for each box, we iterate through all the balls, and distribute them among all the boxes uniformly. We use `next[(j+k)%n]` to store the total probability of having `j+k` balls in `(j+k)%n`-th box at the end of the `i`-th round. We compute the next probability distribution at the end of the current round, and swap `current` and `next` arrays. We clear the `next` array before starting the next round.\n\nFinally, we return the probability distribution that is stored in the `current` array.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
