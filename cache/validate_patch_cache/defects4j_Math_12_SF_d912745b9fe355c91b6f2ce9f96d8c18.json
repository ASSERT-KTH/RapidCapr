    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Without the code, I can't provide the exact solution, but I can suggest some general tips to tackle a timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure the code is not stuck in an infinite loop. Avoid nested loops that can exponentially increase the number of iterations.\n\n2. Optimize your code: Use optimal algorithms and data structures to reduce the number of computations or iterations required.\n\n3. Check for memory leaks: Make sure the code is not consuming too much memory. Avoid creating unnecessary objects or variables.\n\n4. Divide and conquer: If the code is processing a large amount of data, try dividing it into smaller tasks and processing them separately.\n\n5. Increase the timeout: If none of the above steps work, try increasing the timeout duration. \n\nI hope these tips will help you fix the timeout error. If you need further assistance, please provide the code, and I will try my best to assist you.",
