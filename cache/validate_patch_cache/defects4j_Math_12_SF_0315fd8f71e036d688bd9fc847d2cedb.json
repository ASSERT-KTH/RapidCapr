    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working. Without access to the full code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the compilation error you described, it seems that the test is timing out after 600 seconds which indicates that the algorithm used for computation of results is taking too much time to execute.\n\nTo resolve this error, you may have to optimize the current algorithm to reduce the computation time. Some possible ways to do this include:\n\n1. Analyzing the algorithm to identify which parts are taking the most time. You can use a profiler or debugging tools to help with this. Once you identify the problem areas, you can try to reduce the number of calculations or optimize the algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n\n2. Reduce the complexity of the algorithm by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. This will help reduce the overall computation time and make the code easier to optimize.\n\n3. Implement a caching mechanism to store intermediate results and prevent the re-calculation of the same values repeatedly. This approach can help reduce the computation time, particularly if the algorithm involves many calculations.\n\n\n\nAgain, without seeing the code and understanding the computation that is being done, it is difficult to provide more specific advice.",
