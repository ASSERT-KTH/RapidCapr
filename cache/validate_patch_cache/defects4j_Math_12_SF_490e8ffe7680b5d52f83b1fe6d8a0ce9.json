    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. It seems that there is a deeper problem in the code that is causing the timeout. Without seeing the code implementation, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution.\n\nI would suggest the following steps to debug and fix the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that all loops in the code implement the correct exit condition and do not iterate infinitely.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Identify any areas of the code that are inefficient or redundant and optimize them.\n\n3. Simplify the code: Refactor the code to make it simpler and more readable, which can make it easier to identify and fix issues.\n\n4. Break the code into smaller functions: Break the code into smaller functions that are easier to understand and test independently.\n\n5. Add logging: Add logging statements to understand where the code is getting stuck and which values are causing the timeouts.\n\nOnce the issue is identified, fix it by refactoring the code or applying appropriate changes.\n\nI'm sorry that I cannot provide a more specific solution without seeing the code implementation.",
