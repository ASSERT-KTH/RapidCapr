    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it's difficult for me to provide a correct function. However, I can try to provide some general suggestions for addressing the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursive functions in your code that may be causing the timeout.\n\n2. Try to optimize any large loops or functions in your code to reduce execution time.\n\n3. If possible, try to break down your code into smaller functions that can be tested independently. This can help isolate any performance issues and make it easier to pinpoint the problem area.\n\n4. Consider using profiling tools to identify any performance bottlenecks in your code.\n\n5. Finally, make sure you are running your code on a machine with sufficient resources to handle the workload. If your code is particularly demanding, consider using a cloud-based service with more powerful hardware.",
