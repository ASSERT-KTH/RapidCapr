    "patch": "I apologize for the error. Without seeing the code, I cannot suggest a specific solution. However, it looks like the `testDistributionClone()` test case is timing out. This could be due to a performance issue, infinite loop, or other types of long-running code.\n\nHere are a few general strategies that could help fix the issue:\n\n1. Look for performance bottlenecks: Check the code to see if it contains any expensive operations. This could include operations with high time complexity like loops, nested loops, or nested recursion. If so, consider optimizing the code, for example by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops: Make sure there are no infinite loops in the code that could cause the test to hang. This could happen if the loop condition is not set up properly, or if there is a logic error that causes the loop to never exit.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value: If none of the above solutions work, consider increasing the maximum timeout value for the test. It's important to note that this is not a good long-term solution and should only be used as a last resort.\n\nI hope this helps you fix the issue. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like more specific advice once you provide me with the code snippet.",
