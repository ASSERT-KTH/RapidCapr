Here is the corrected function:\n``` java\npublic static double[] randomDistribution(int size, double sum){\n    Random random = new Random();\n    double[] distribution = new double[size];\n    double total = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < size-1; i++) {\n        double r = random.nextDouble();\n        distribution[i] = r;\n        total += r;\n    }\n    distribution[size-1] = sum - total;\n    return distribution;\n}\n```\nThis should fix the timeout issue and also generate proper random distributions.",
