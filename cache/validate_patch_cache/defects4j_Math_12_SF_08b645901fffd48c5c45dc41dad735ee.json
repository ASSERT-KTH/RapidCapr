Without seeing the code or knowing the context of the problem it is difficult for me to provide a correct function.\n\nHowever, since the test is timing out, it is likely that the function is taking too long to execute. You may want to consider optimizing the function to improve its performance. You can also try increasing the timeout value for the test if possible.\n\nIf you could provide more information or the code itself, I would be happy to help you further.",
