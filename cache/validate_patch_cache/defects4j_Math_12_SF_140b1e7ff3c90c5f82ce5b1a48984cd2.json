    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not work. Without seeing the code in question, it is difficult for me to provide a fix that will work for you. However, I can suggest some general tips for fixing a function that is timing out:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Take a look at your function and make sure there are no infinite loops. If there are, you'll need to fix them before your code will run within the allotted time.\n\n2. Optimize your code: If your function is timing out because it's taking too long to execute, you may be able to optimize it to run faster. Try using more efficient algorithms or data structures, or consider simplifying your code.\n\n3. Split your function into smaller functions: If your function is doing too much, you may be able to split it into smaller functions that can be called separately, rather than trying to do everything at once.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above options work, you may need to increase the timeout of your test to give your function more time to execute. However, this may only be a temporary solution, and you'll still need to optimize your function in the long term.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information about the code and the specific error message you're seeing, I may be able to provide more targeted advice.",
