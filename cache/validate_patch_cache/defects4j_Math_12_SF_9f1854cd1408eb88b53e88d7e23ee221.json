    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. The timeout error suggests that the code is still taking too long to execute.\n\nWithout seeing the code and test implementation, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to run, and the code needs to be optimized to reduce the time complexity.\n\nHere are some general tips to optimize code for better performance:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures: choose the right data structure for your algorithm. For example, if you need to frequently add and remove elements, use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList.\n\n2. Reduce redundant calculations: if a calculation is repeated many times, consider caching or storing the result to reduce the computational cost.\n\n3. Avoid excessive memory usage: if your algorithm uses a lot of memory, it can slow down the execution time.\n\n4. Streamline operations: look for opportunities to combine or simplify operations to reduce the overall complexity of the algorithm.\n\n5. Use divide and conquer: break the problem down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently and then combine the results.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the code and test implementation, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
