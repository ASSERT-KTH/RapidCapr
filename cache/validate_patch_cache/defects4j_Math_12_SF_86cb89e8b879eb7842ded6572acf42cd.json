Here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or extremely long iteration times in your code. \n2. Review the test cases and ensure that they are not too complex or time-consuming. \n3. Consider optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough. \n4. Increase the time allowed for the test to run, if possible.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
