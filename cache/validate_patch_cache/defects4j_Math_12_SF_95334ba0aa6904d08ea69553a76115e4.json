    "patch": "I apologize for the previous mistake. Since the code snippet is not provided, I can only suggest some general approaches to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for any unnecessary loops or conditions and optimize them to improve the performance.\n2. Reduce the test data size: Try to reduce the size of the test data, if possible. This can reduce the execution time of tests.\n3. Use multithreading: If your programming language supports multithreading, try to use it to execute tests in parallel. This can reduce the execution time of tests.\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above approaches work, you can increase the timeout duration to give the code more time to execute.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's hard to provide a more specific solution.
