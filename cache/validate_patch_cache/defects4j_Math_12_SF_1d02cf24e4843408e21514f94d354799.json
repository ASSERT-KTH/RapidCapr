    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. As the code provided is not available, I cannot debug the issue causing the timeout. However, I can suggest some general strategies to debug a code timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Ensure that your code is not stuck in an infinite loop. This can often cause a program to continue running indefinitely and eventually timeout.\n\n2. Optimize your code: Check for any unnecessary loops or operations that can be optimized to make your code more efficient.\n\n3. Reduce input size: If the code is timing out on large inputs, try to reduce the input size to see if the code runs correctly on smaller inputs. This can help to pinpoint where the issue lies.\n\n4. Increase timeout threshold: If none of the above works, you may need to increase the timeout threshold to allow more time for the code to run. However, this is not always a recommended solution as it can mask the underlying issue.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any additional information or code, please feel free to share it with me and I can provide better assistance.",
