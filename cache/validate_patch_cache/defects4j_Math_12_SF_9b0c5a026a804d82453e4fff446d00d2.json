    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working. Unfortunately, since I don't have access to the code or test cases, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, I can suggest some troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or memory leaks in the code. This may be causing the timeout error.\n\n2. Verify that the test cases are correctly written and that they cover all possible scenarios.\n\n3. If the code is complex and hard to debug, consider using a debugging tool.\n\n4. Try to isolate the problematic section of code and see if you can reproduce the error with a simpler test case.\n\n5. If all else fails, consider reaching out to a colleague or seeking help from an expert in the relevant programming language or framework.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.",
