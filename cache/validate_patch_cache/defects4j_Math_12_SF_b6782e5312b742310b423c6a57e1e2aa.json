Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing. \n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or extremely long iteration times in your code. \n2. Review the test cases and ensure that they are not too complex or time-consuming. \n3. Consider optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough. \n4. If you are using a third-party library, ensure that it is up-to-date and compatible with your code. \n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
