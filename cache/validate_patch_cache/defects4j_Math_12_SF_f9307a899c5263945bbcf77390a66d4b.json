    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the suggested fix didn't work either. Unfortunately, without the code to analyze and debug, it's difficult to provide a solution. \n\nHowever, the error message you are seeing suggests that the test is taking too long to execute (more than 10 minutes). This could indicate an issue with the implementation of the function or something in the test environment.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to try:\n\n1. Optimize the implementation of the function to reduce its execution time.\n2. Increase the timeout limit for the test.\n3. Check for any memory leaks or other system resource issues that could be causing the test to take a long time to execute.\n4. Consider splitting the test into smaller, more focused tests that run faster and are easier to debug.\n\nI hope these suggestions help and that you are able to resolve the issue.",
