    "patch": "Apologies for the previous response. Based on the error message, it is likely that there is a syntax error elsewhere in the code, which is causing the \"illegal start of type\" error. \n\nHowever, assuming that there are no other syntax errors in the code, the fix for the removed buggy line would depend on the purpose of the `rhsContext` variable and how it is used in the subsequent code. Without this context, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix.\n\nCan you please provide more context about the purpose of `rhsContext` and how it is used in the code?",
