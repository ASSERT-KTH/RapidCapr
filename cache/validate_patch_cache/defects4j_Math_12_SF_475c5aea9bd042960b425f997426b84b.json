    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that did not work for you. Please try the following implementation:\n\n```\npublic static void normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    double sum = Arrays.stream(distribution).sum();\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        distribution[i] /= sum;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the cases where all the values in the array are 0 and normalizes the input distribution in place. \n\nThe implementation calculates the sum of the elements in the array using the `Arrays.stream` method. If the sum is 0, there is no need to normalize the array, so the method returns early. If the sum is non-zero, the method iterates through the elements in the input array and divides each element by the sum to normalize the distribution in place.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
