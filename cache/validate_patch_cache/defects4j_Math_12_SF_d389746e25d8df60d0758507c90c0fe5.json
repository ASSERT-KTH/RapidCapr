    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the actual code and specific details about the issue, I am unable to provide a correct function. \n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to complete and is timing out after 600 seconds. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as inefficient code or a large input size.\n\nOne approach to resolving this issue is to optimize the code to reduce its execution time. Another approach is to increase the timeout duration for the test.\n\nPlease provide the full code and any additional details or error messages, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
