    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. Without seeing the relevant code, I can only provide general guidelines on how to approach fixing the issue.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or inefficient code blocks that may cause the program to slow down. If so, optimize the code by removing the redundant code and making algorithmic improvements.\n\n2. Re-analyze the test cases to ensure that the test assertions and input validation are correct. Verify if the unit tests have appropriate input with a correct boundary condition. \n\n3. Reduce the amount of data being processed in the code. If the code is processing large data sets, consider reducing the input size or process it in chunks.\n\n4. Check for potential memory leaks or memory-intensive operations in the code. See if you can manage the memory usage by reducing external dependencies or by using efficient data structures.\n\nIf you can provide more details about the code or share the code, I can further assist you in fixing the issue.",
