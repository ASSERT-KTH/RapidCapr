We then create the direction vector for the new line by multiplying the original `direction` by `-1` using `direction.scalarMultiply(-1)`. Finally, we create the new line with `endPoint` as the origin and the newly created direction vector. This should give us a line with the same length but in the opposite direction to the original line. Please let me know if this resolves the issue.",
