    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the previous fix was not sufficient. Since the issue is a timeout error, it's likely that the function needs to be optimized. Without further details on the code and its performance characteristics, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips on optimizing code and preventing timeout errors:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures: Avoid using slow data structures like linked lists and instead use arrays or hash tables where possible.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary computation: Check if there are any unnecessary loops or computations that can be removed. \n\n3. Perform computations incrementally: If the code involves a large computation, consider breaking it up into smaller pieces that can be computed incrementally.\n\n4. Identify the bottleneck: Use profiling tools to identify which part of the code is taking the most time and focus your optimization efforts on that portion.\n\n5. Run the code on a test dataset with similar characteristics to the production data to identify other possible issues like memory bloat or functional issues as well.",
