    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not work. Without seeing the full code and understanding the context of the bug, it's difficult for me to provide a complete and accurate solution to the problem. The error you're experiencing could be due to various factors such as a long-running loop or an infinite loop.\n\nHowever, I suggest you try the following approach:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops in your code by adding print statements or using a debugger to identify any sections that don't exit.\n\n2. Make sure that any loops or recursive calls have a definite termination condition.\n\n3. Try to optimize your code for better time complexity by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n4. Break down your code into smaller functions or methods with a clear definition of the functionality. \n\n5. If none of the above work, you may need to consider rewriting some parts of your code to improve its overall efficiency.\n\nAgain, without seeing your full code and understanding the context of the problem, it's difficult to provide a precise solution.",
