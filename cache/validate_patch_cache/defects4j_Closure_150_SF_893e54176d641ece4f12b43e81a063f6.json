One possible cause could be mismatched or outdated compiler versions.\n\nTo resolve this error, I suggest trying the following steps:\n\n1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the compiler. You can check the version number of your current Javacompiler by running the following command in your terminal: `javac -version`. If your version is outdated, try updating it to the latest version.\n\n2. Clean and rebuild your project. Sometimes this error can be caused by corrupted build files or cache.
