Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the code might be taking too much time to execute, causing the test to time out. Here are some tips that might help resolve this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code for performance by using efficient algorithms and data structures.\n2. Try reducing the input size for the function, if possible, to reduce the execution time.\n3. Increase the timeout value for the test, if possible.\n4. Consider using a parallel processing framework like multithreading or multiprocessing if feasible.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
