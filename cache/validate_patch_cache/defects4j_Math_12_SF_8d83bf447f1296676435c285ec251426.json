    "patch": "I'm sorry about that, I understand the frustration this issue might have caused.\n\nWithout seeing the code and specific test cases, it's difficult to identify the root cause of the error and provide a correct solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check the algorithm: Make sure the algorithm used in the function is the most efficient one to solve the problem. If the algorithm is too complex or inefficient, it might lead to the time-out error.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Try to optimize the code by reducing unnecessary computations or utilizing efficient data structures. \n\n3. Analyze the test cases: Identify the test case that is causing the issue and analyze it thoroughly. This might give some insight into the root cause of the time-out error.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value: If increasing the timeout value is an option, try increasing it to give more time for the function to complete its execution.\n\n5. Use a parallel algorithm: If the code is doing a large computation, consider implementing a parallel algorithm that can leverage multiple processing units effectively.\n\nI hope these tips help resolve the time-out error. If you could provide more information about the code and specific test cases, I would be happy to provide more specific advice.",
