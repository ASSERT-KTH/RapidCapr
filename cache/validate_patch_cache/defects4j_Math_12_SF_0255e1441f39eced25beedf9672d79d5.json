    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without access to the full code and test suite, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to help you fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Check if there is a infinite loop in the code. You may need to add a break condition or check if there is a specific input that causes the infinite loop.\n\n2. Check if there are complex computations or operations in the code that take too long to execute. You may need to optimize the code by using algorithms that have lower time complexity.\n\n3. Check if the test suite is too large or has unnecessary tests. You may need to remove redundant or irrelevant tests.\n\n4. Check if the environment where the code is running has enough resources like memory and processing power. You may need to allocate more resources or run the code in a different environment with better resources.\n\n5. Check if there are any external dependencies in the code that may cause the timeout. You may need to update those dependencies or remove them entirely. \n\nI hope these tips are helpful for fixing the timeout error.",
