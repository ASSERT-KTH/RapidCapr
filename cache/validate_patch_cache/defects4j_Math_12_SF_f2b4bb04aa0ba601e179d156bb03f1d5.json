    "patch": "Without seeing the code that contains the bug, it is difficult to provide a correct version. However, if the test is timing out, it could be due to a performance issue. Here are some general tips to improve the performance of a function:\n\n1. Look for nested loops or recursive calls that could be causing the function to iterate over a large amount of data multiple times. Consider optimizing the loop or finding a more efficient algorithm to reduce the amount of iterations.\n\n2. If the function accesses a database or external service, consider caching the results to avoid unnecessary calls.\n\n3. In some cases, parallelizing the code can improve performance. Consider using multithreading or parallel processing to split the workload across multiple threads.\n\n4. If the function is doing a lot of memory allocation, consider optimizing the memory usage by reusing objects instead of creating new ones.\n\n5. Check for any memory leaks that could be causing the function to run slowly or causing it to run out of memory. \n\nIf you can provide the code that contains the bug, it will be easier to identify the root cause and provide a more specific solution.",
