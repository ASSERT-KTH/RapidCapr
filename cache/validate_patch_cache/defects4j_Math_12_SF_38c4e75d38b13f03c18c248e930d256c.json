    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous suggestion did not work. Without any code to work with, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the previous solution caused the test to run for too long and timed out.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Try to optimize the function by reducing any unnecessary computations or loops.\n\n2. Check if the code is stuck in an infinite loop or if there is a deadlock.\n\n3. If possible, run the function on smaller inputs and see if it completes successfully. This may help you identify a specific part of the function that is causing the timeout.\n\n4. If the function is still timing out, consider changing the test case to allow for a longer timeout or increasing the timeout threshold for the test runner.\n\nI hope these tips help you resolve the issue. If you provide more specific information, I may be able to provide a more targeted solution.",
