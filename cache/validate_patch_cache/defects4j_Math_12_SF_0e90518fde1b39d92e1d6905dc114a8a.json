    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without knowing the specific code, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution, but here are some general tips to address time-out errors:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Review the current code and see if there are any parts that can be optimized or simplified to reduce the processing time. Such optimizations can include reducing the number of loops or nested loops, reducing the number of if/else statements or eliminating recursion.\n\n2. Reduce the input size:  If possible, reduce the input size to the code to minimize the number of calculations that need to be done. Such reduction can eliminate unnecessary calculations and reduce run time.\n\n3. Improve the data structure implementation: Use efficient data structures and reduce the number of data accessing operations in the current data structure. Therefore, optimize the data structure implementation to reduce the processing time.\n\n4. Increase memory allocation: Increasing the memory allocation to the algorithm can help spped up the processing time for some algorithms that involve large amounts of data.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution but I hope these tips help.",
