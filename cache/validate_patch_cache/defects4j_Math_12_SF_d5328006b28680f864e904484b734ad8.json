However, if you're experiencing timeout issues, it could be due to a performance bottleneck in the code.\n\nYou can try the following steps to improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. Check for repeated computation or redundant code and eliminate them. \n\n2. Optimize any recursive or iterative algorithms in the code \n\n3. Use appropriate data structures for the algorithm to ensure faster retrieval or access to data.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the code, I may be able to provide further suggestions.",
