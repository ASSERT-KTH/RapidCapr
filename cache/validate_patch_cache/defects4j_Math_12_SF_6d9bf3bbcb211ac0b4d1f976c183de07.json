Without seeing the original code and the context of the test cases, it's difficult for me to pinpoint the issue and provide a correct function.\n\nIt is possible that the function is taking too long to run or there may be other factors causing the timeout error. I would suggest optimizing the code or breaking it down into smaller functions if possible.\n\nIf you could provide me with the original code and additional context or test cases, I may be able to assist you further.",
