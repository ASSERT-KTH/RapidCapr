    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. Without seeing the code and specific test case, it is difficult to provide a solution. However, the test timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there may be an infinite loop or a performance issue in the code. I recommend reviewing the code to ensure there are no infinite loops or other performance issues. You may also want to consider optimizing the code or breaking it down into smaller functions to improve performance.",
