    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. Without seeing the specific code that you are referring to, it's difficult to provide an exact fix. However, based on the error message you have provided, it sounds like there is an issue with an equals sign (=) being used incorrectly. In particular, the error message suggests that an equals sign is being used as an operand where it should not be.\n\nTo correct the issue, you should look for any instances where you are using the equals sign incorrectly. Some common mistakes include using a single equals sign when you should be using a double equals sign for comparison (i.e., == instead of =) or using an equals sign in the wrong order (i.e., variable = value instead of value = variable).\n\nIf you're still having issues, please provide more information or the relevant code snippet and I'll do my best to assist you further.",
