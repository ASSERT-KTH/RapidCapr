Without the full context of the code, I can only provide general suggestions to resolve the compilation error.\n\nThe error message \"class, interface, or enum expected\" indicates that there may be a syntax error in the code that is preventing it from being compiled properly. Some possible causes for this error are:\n\n- Missing curly braces: Check that all opening and closing curly braces are properly matched.\n- Unbalanced parentheses: Verify that all parentheses are properly balanced and closed.\n- Missing semicolons: Make sure that all statement lines in the code end with a semicolon.\n\nPlease check your code for any syntax errors, and make sure that all statements are properly formatted. If you can provide more details about the code or the infill location, I can offer more specific guidance.",
