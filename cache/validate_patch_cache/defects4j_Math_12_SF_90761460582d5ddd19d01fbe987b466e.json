    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working as expected and for the timeout error. Without seeing the code, it's hard to provide a specific solution, but you can try the following:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for any loops, recursion, or other performance bottlenecks that could be causing the test to exceed the time limit.\n\n2. Split the test into smaller tests: Instead of testing everything in one go, split the test into smaller tests. This will help in pinpointing the exact issue and in reducing the test duration.\n\n3. Increase the time limit: If the timeout limit is set to 600 seconds, it's possible that the test needs more time to complete. Increase the time limit to a suitable value, and try running the test again.\n\n4. Use mocks or stubs: If the test involves network or I/O operations, you can use mocks or stubs to simulate the actual behavior. This will help in reducing the test duration.\n\nHowever, if none of these steps work, and you are still facing the timeout issue, please provide me with more detailed information on the code and the specific test that is failing to help me provide a more focused solution.",
