Unfortunately, without access to the original code and additional information about the problem, it is difficult to provide a solution that ensures the test will pass without timing out.\n\nHowever, here are a few recommendations that may help resolve the issue:\n\n- Check if there are any performance bottlenecks in the code.\n- Ensure that the test environment has sufficient resources to run the test.\n- Use a profiling tool to identify the parts of the code that are taking the most time and optimize them.\n- Consider re-designing the algorithm or data structures to achieve better performance.\n\nIf you could share the original code and more information about the problem, I could provide more specific recommendations to help resolve the issue.",
