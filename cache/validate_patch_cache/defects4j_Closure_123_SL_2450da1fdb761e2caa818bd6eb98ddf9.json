    "patch": "It is difficult to suggest a specific line of code without more context, but it seems like the issue in `testPrintInOperatorInForLoop` is related to the initialization of variable `a` within the `for` loop. The original buggy line removed was `Context rhsContext = Context.OTHER;` which does not seem to be related to the test failure. \n\nWithout knowing more about the code and the specific test case, it is difficult to provide a fix.",
