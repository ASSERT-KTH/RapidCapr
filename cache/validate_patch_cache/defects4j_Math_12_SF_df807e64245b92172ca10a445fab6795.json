    "patch": "I apologize for the continued errors. Without seeing the code itself, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix. However, the fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there may be an infinite loop or an inefficient algorithm causing the code to hang. \n\nOne possible approach is to analyze the code and identify any loops that could potentially result in an infinite loop, or any calculations that could cause the algorithm to hang. Another approach is to optimize the code by using more efficient data structures, algorithms, or design patterns.\n\nHowever, without more details on the actual code and test case, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. Please provide more information or code snippets so that I can better assist you.",
