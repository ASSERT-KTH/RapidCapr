    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that. Without being able to see the code and analyze the issue, I can't provide a solution that will definitely fix the timeout error. \n\nHowever, here are some general tips that might help you deal with the problem:\n\n1. Check if your code is stuck in an infinite loop or recursion that leads to the timeout error. In this case, you need to find and remove the problematic code.\n\n2. If you are working with very large data sets, consider optimizing your code to reduce its time complexity. \n\n3. Make sure you are not using any blocking or expensive operations in your code, such as I/O operations or calling external APIs. If you are, try finding ways to optimize them or parallelize the operations.\n\n4. Finally, you could try increasing the timeout limit for the test to allow your code more time to execute. \n\nAfter taking one or more of these steps, try running the test again to see if the timeout error has been resolved.",
