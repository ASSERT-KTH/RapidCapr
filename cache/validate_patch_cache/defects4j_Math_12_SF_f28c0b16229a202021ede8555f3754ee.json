    "patch": "I apologize for any inconvenience caused. Without seeing the specific code, I can only provide general guidance to help fix the issue. \n\nGenerally, a timeout error occurs when a function takes longer than the maximum allowed time to complete. Here are some tips to fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Review the code and check if there are inefficiencies that could be improved. Look for any unnecessary computations or iterations. Try to simplify any complex loops or recursion and use more efficient data structures.\n\n2. Parallel processing: If the function is doing a lot of calculations, it may be possible to take advantage of multi-threading or parallel processing to speed up the execution. Care should be taken when implementing this approach as it can also introduce additional overhead.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit: If the function is legitimately taking a long time to execute, you may need to increase the maximum time allowed for the test to complete. This will depend on the specific requirements of your use case and how long you can afford the function to take.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties after trying these strategies, please provide more detailed information and context so I can better assist you.",
