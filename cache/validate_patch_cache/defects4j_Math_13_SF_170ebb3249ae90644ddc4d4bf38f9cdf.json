The test code may have passed a large matrix to the method, causing it to run out of memory. To fix this error, you can increase the memory allocation for the JVM by setting the `-Xmx` option when running the test. For example, you can run the test with the command `java -Xmx4g TestClass`, which allocates 4 GB of memory to the JVM. Alternatively, you can optimize the implementation of the `EigenDecomposition` class to reduce memory usage.",
