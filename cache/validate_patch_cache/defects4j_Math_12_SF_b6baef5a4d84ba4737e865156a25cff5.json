    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts not resolving the issue. After further analysis, I have identified that the main cause of the timeout is that the implementation is still not efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nTo address this issue, I am providing an updated implementation that is more efficient and should pass all the tests:\n\n```\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static double[] distribution(double[] data) {\n        if (data.length == 0) {\n            return new double[]{};\n        }\n        Arrays.sort(data);\n        double[] res = new double[data.length];\n        double val = data[0];\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n            if (data[i] == val) {\n                count++;\n            } else {\n                double probability = ((double) count) / data.length;\n                for (int j = i - count; j < i; j++) {\n                    res[j] = probability;\n                }\n                val = data[i];\n                count = 1;\n            }\n        }\n        double probability = ((double) count) / data.length;\n        for (int j = data.length - count; j < data.length; j++) {\n            res[j] = probability;\n        }\n\n        return res;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation sorts the input array and scans linearly through the sorted array while updating the probability using the count variable, thus achieving a time complexity of O(n*log(n)) due to sorting.\n\nI hope this implementation works correctly for you.",
