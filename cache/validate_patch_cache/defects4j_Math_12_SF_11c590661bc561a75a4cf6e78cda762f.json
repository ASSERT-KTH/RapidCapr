However, without the actual code that is causing the issue, I cannot provide a corrected function. \n\nThe timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute and may have an infinite loop or other performance issue. I recommend reviewing the code and optimizing it if possible, or providing more information about the issue so that I can offer more specific advice.",
