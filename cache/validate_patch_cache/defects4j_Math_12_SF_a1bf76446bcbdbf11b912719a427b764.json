    "patch": "I apologize for that, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. \n\nWithout any code or additional information, it's hard for me to provide an accurate solution. However, based on the error message you provided, I suspect that your test is taking too long to run, and it is eventually timing out.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Ensure that your algorithm's time complexity is not too high. Check to make sure that you're not running nested loops that unnecessarily increase the algorithm's time complexity.\n2. Try to optimize the algorithms used in the code to reduce the processing time.\n3. Check if you can make use of built-in functions that can do the work in a more efficient way.\n4. Consider running your code on fewer test cases, or reduce the size of the input data in the test case.\n5. Try to increase the timeout parameter for this specific test case.\n\nIf none of these steps work, it may be helpful to investigate the cause of the test case's slowness by implementing some logging or debugging measures to see which parts of the code are causing the most delays. That information can be used to optimize the code further.\n\nIf you share the code and the relevant test case, I'd be glad to provide a more specific solution to your problem.",
