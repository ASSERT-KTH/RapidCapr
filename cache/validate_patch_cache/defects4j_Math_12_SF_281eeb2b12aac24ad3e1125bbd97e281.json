    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working as expected. Without knowing the specific code, it is difficult for me to provide a solution that would definitely fix this compilation error. However, here are some general steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check if the test is stuck in an infinite loop or if it is waiting for input that never arrives. You can add logging statements or breakpoints to help identify where the test is stuck.\n\n2. If the test is running fine locally but not on the server, make sure that the server environment is properly configured. Check if the server has enough memory, CPU, and disk space to run the test.\n\n3. Consider optimizing the code by identifying any bottlenecks or performance issues. You can use profiling tools to identify the slowest parts of the code and then optimize it.\n\n4. If the test is failing due to a specific exception, review the exception message and the stack trace to identify the root cause of the issue. Once you have identified the issue, you can write a fix to resolve the exception.\n\nWithout more information about the code and the specific exception message, it is hard for me to provide more specific advice. If you could provide additional details, I would be happy to help you find a solution.",
