    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that have not worked for you. Here's another implementation that should resolve the issue:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = Arrays.stream(distribution).sum();\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return Arrays.copyOf(distribution, distribution.length);\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation first handles cases of a null or empty `distribution` input array. If the sum of the elements in the array is zero, it creates a new array that is a copy of the input array and returns it. If the sum is non-zero, it creates a new double array called `normalized`, and uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in the input array, dividing each element by the sum and storing the quotient in the corresponding position in `normalized`.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
