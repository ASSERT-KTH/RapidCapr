    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and the test that are causing the timeout, it's difficult for me to provide a specific fix. However, here are some general strategies you can try to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize your code to reduce the runtime complexity. You can analyze the code using a profiler to identify the parts that are taking the most time to execute. Once you identify those parts, you can try to optimize them.\n\n2. Increase the timeout limit. If you know that the function takes a long time to complete, you can increase the timeout limit for the test. However, this is generally not recommended since it can hide underlying issues with the code.\n\n3. Simplify the test. If the test is too complex, you can try to simplify it by reducing the size of the input or by removing unnecessary asserts.\n\n4. Use parallel testing. If your code supports parallel execution, you can split the test into smaller parts and execute them in parallel. This can help reduce the overall runtime.\n\n5. Check for resource leaks. If your code is leaking resources such as memory or file handles, it can slow down the execution over time. Make sure you release all resources that you acquire in the code.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have more information about the code and the test that are causing the timeout, please let me know and I can provide more specific advice.",
