    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the previous fix was not successful in resolving the issue. Without more information on the code and test cases, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, here are some strategies to resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for inefficiencies in the code: Look for any redundant computations or unnecessary looping. Simplify the code as much as possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If feasible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce the input size: If possible, test the code on smaller input data to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nAgain, without specific information on the code and test cases, it is difficult to provide a more targeted solution. I apologize for any inconvenience, and I hope this helps in resolving the issue.",
