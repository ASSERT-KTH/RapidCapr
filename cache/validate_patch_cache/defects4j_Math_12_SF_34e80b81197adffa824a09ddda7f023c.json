Without the code or more information about the issue, I am unable to provide the solution.\n\nHowever, the timeout error suggests that the code may have an inefficiency in its algorithm or may be stuck in an infinite loop. It could also be due to excessive data or inadequate computational resources.\n\nWithout more information, it is difficult to pinpoint the issue and provide a fix. Could you please provide more details about the code and its execution environment?",
