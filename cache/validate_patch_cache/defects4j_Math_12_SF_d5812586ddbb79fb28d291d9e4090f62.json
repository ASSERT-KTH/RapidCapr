    "patch": "If the code is timing out, it could indicate that there is a problem with the implementation's algorithmic efficiency. It is necessary to take a closer look at the code and refactor it to optimize the performance. Here are some general tips to make the code more efficient:\n\n1. Use appropriate data structures: Choose appropriate data structures that can efficiently handle your problem. Use data structures such as hashmaps or trees to handle large datasets efficiently.\n\n2. Optimize algorithm complexity: Ensure to use the optimal algorithm complexity by avoiding nested loops and reduce unnecessary computations.\n\n3. Use parallel processing: If possible, consider using parallel processing or multi-threading to break down large computations into multiple smaller ones.\n\n4. Optimize memory usage: Ensure that your code does not use excessive memory. Unnecessary memory usage can lead to slow program execution.\n\n5. Optimize I/O: If your code involves input/output, consider using buffered I/O for optimal performance.\n\nIf you can provide more context or code, I can help guide you more specifically on how to optimize your code.",
