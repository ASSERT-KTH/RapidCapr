    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the exact code and test cases, I'm unable to provide a specific solution, but here are a few general tips that might help:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check if there are any nested loops or unnecessary computations that can be removed. Also, make sure that you are using appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve the problem efficiently.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, split the code into smaller tasks and parallelize them using threads or coroutines. Be careful though, as parallelization can introduce its own set of issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n\n3. Optimize the test cases: Check if the test cases can be restructured to reduce the execution time, for example, by using smaller input sizes.\n\n4. Use a profiler: Use a profiler tool to identify the hotspots in the code, which can help you pinpoint the areas that need optimization.\n\n5. Increase the timeout parameter: If the time limit is too strict, try increasing the timeout parameter to allow for longer execution times. However, this might not be a feasible solution in all cases.\n\nI hope this helps in some way. If you can provide more details or the specific code and test cases, I can look into it further and provide a more targeted solution.",
