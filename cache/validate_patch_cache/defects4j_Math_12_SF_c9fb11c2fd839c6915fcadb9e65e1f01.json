    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Without having access to the code that is causing the timeout error, I am unable to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are a few tips that may help resolve the issue of timeouts in your code:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Ensure that your code does not have any infinite loops that would cause the program to run indefinitely.\n\n2. Evaluate the time complexity of your program: Determine if your code is taking too long to execute by analyzing its time complexity and checking for any inefficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n3. Look for optimizations: If possible, optimize your code by removing unnecessary operations or using more efficient algorithms and data structures.\n\n4. Consider parallelization: If your code is performing many CPU-bound operations, consider parallelizing the code to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\nOnce you have identified the cause of the timeout error, you can modify your code accordingly to fix the issue.",
