    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it means that the code is taking too long to execute. Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some changes that might help to fix the issue.\n\nFirstly, make sure that the code is only handling the necessary input parameters and returning the correct output values. It's important to ensure that the code is not running any unnecessary computations or loops that could cause the test to time out.\n\nSecondly, try to optimize any loops or computations to reduce the overall execution time of the code. This could involve using different data structures or algorithms that are more efficient.\n\nLastly, you could try increasing the computing resources available to run the code, such as increasing the amount of memory allocated to the program or running it on a more powerful machine.\n\nIf the issue persists, it may be necessary to analyze the code more closely to identify the root cause of the timeout error.",
