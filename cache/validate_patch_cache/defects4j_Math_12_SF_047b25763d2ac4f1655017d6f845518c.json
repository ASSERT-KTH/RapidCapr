    "patch": "I am sorry for the inconvenience. Without looking at the code, it is difficult for me to determine the cause of the timeout error. However, here are some general tips that could help resolve this issue:\n\n1. Add logging statements: Inserting logging statements throughout the code, especially in the suspect areas, can help identify why the code is taking too long to run.\n\n2. Use a profiler: Profilers help to identify performance bottlenecks and resource consumption issues. Profilers can be used to track which methods are taking the most time to execute and potentially identify areas for optimization.\n\n3. Use a debugger: Similar to profiling, a debugger can be used to identify where the code is getting stuck or taking too long to execute. The debugger can be used to step through the code line by line to see where the issue is occurring.\n\n4. Review the algorithm: Double-checking the algorithm being used can sometimes help identify issues. If there is a better algorithm or data structure that can be used, it may help speed up the execution time.\n\n5. Consider splitting tests: If a specific test is taking too long to run, consider splitting it into smaller, more manageable tests.\n\nI hope this helps. If you provide me with the specific code, I may be able to offer more targeted advice.",
