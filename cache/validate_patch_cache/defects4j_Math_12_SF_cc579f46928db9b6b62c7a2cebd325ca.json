Without access to the actual code or the specific bug, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nThe fact that the code takes more than 600 seconds to run suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a performance issue within the code. \n\nI suggest using a profiler to determine exactly where the performance issue is coming from, optimizing the performance issue, and then running the test again. \n\nIf you could provide more context or specific code, I would be happy to try to provide a specific solution.",
