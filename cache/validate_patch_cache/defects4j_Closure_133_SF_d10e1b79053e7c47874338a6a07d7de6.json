Check if the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method returns `null` in some cases and handle it accordingly.\n\n2. Verify if the `jsdocParser.parse()` method is being called with the correct arguments.

If so, investigate the error message to determine the cause.\n\n4. If all else fails, try debugging the code by stepping through the program execution line by line and inspecting variable values.\n\nAgain, without more information or access to the program code, it's difficult to provide a definite solution. I hope these suggestions help you narrow down the issue and ultimately find a solution.",
