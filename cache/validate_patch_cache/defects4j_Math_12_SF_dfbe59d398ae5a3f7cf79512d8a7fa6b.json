    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix didn't resolve the issue either. Without access to the code, it's difficult for me to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general guidelines that may help you in fixing the issue:\n\n1. Check if the code is running parallel threads that may cause a deadlock or hang. If so, consider synchronizing the threads or implementing other concurrency control mechanisms.\n\n2. If the issue is related to I/O operations or network requests, make sure that proper timeouts and exception handling are implemented.\n\n3. Consider profiling the code to identify any performance hotspots or memory leaks that may cause the code to hang or time out.\n\n4. Check if the test data is too large, which might cause the code to take a long time to process. If so, you may need to optimize the code or reduce the data size.\n\n5. Increase the timeout value to give the code more time to execute, if necessary. However, this should be considered a temporary workaround, as it may not solve the underlying issue.\n\nIf the issue persists after trying these solutions, you may need to consult with a more experienced developer or seek help from the community.",
