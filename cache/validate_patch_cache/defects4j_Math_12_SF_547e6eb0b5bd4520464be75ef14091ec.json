    "patch": "It's difficult to provide an exact solution without seeing the code. However, a common reason for a test timing out is that the code is taking too long to execute. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including inefficient algorithms, poor data structures, or inefficient I/O operations.\n\nHere are some general tips for resolving issues with code that is timing out:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Identify the slowest part of the code and optimize it to reduce its runtime. This could involve using more efficient data structures, improving algorithmic complexity, or reducing the amount of I/O operations.\n\n2. Use caching: If the code is performing repeated calculations that are slow, consider using caching to avoid recalculating the same results repeatedly.\n\n3. Increase the system resources: If possible, increase the system resources allocated to the code, such as CPU cores or memory, to improve its performance.\n\n4. Separate the code into smaller functions: If the code is large and complex, consider separating it into smaller, more manageable functions. This can help identify the specific parts of the code that are causing performance issues.\n\n5. Use profiling tools: Use profiling tools to identify the specific parts of the code that are causing performance issues. This can help optimize the code more effectively.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code it's difficult to provide a specific solution, but these general tips should help resolve issues with code that is timing out.",
