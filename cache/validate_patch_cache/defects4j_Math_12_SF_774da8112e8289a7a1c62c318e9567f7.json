    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Without the actual code, it's difficult for me to provide a correct function. \n\nRegarding the timeout error, it seems like the test case is taking too long to execute and eventually timing out. You could try optimizing the code to reduce its execution time. Alternatively, you could increase the timeout period for the test case to allow it to complete. \n\nCan you please provide the code along with the test case itself so that I can provide better assistance?",
