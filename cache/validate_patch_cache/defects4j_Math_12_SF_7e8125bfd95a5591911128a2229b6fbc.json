    "patch": "If the code is still timing out after the clone method has been correctly implemented, there may be other issues with the code that are causing the timeout. \n\nWithout seeing the entire codebase and understanding the requirements of the system, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the timeout issue. However, here are some general tips that could help:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursion that may be causing the code to run indefinitely. This can be done by setting breakpoints or logging statements at various points in the code to track the flow of execution.\n\n2. Review the complexity of the code and consider optimizing any slow or inefficient parts. For example, if the code is running multiple nested loops or is performing costly calculations, consider ways to reduce the complexity or improve efficiency (e.g., using memoization, caching, or dynamic programming).\n\n3. Analyze the code for any potential race conditions or synchronization issues that may be causing the code to hang or stall. This can be done by reviewing the use of locks, semaphores, or other concurrency mechanisms in the code.\n\n4. Consider limiting the scope of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules. This can help identify specific areas of the code that may be causing issues and provide a more manageable debugging and optimization process.\n\n5. Consult with other developers or experts in the field who may have experience with similar applications or systems. They may be able to provide insights or suggestions that can help to identify the underlying issues and provide solutions.\n\nIn summary, fixing timeouts requires analysis and understanding of the entire codebase and its requirements. The suggestions above are general approaches that may help to identify problems and improve the performance of the code.",
