Without seeing the code and the test cases, it's difficult for me to provide a solution that will surely work. \n\nI recommend that you try optimizing the code and improving the test cases to avoid such errors. Alternatively, you may seek help from a human programmer who can go through the code and help you identify and fix the issues.",
