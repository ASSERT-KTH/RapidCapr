    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. \n\nWithout seeing the actual code that is causing the error, it's hard to give a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that there might be an issue with an equals sign ( = ) in your code.\n\nTo address the error, please check for any instance where you have used \"=\" as a comparison operator instead of \"==\" or where you might have used a single \"=\" in an assignment statement.\n\nOnce you have fixed this error, please retry compiling the code and the issue should be resolved. If you continue to have issues, please provide more information and the relevant code snippet so I can assist you better.",
