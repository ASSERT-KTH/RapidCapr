    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Based on the timeout error, it seems like there may be an issue with the efficiency of the current implementation. Without access to more specific details, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution.\n\nI recommend trying the following solutions:\n- Try to optimize the current implementation for efficiency, such as reducing the number of loops or improving data structures.\n- Break up long test cases into smaller ones to reduce the overall running time.\n- Increase the timeout limit for the test case if possible, though this may not be a long-term solution.\n\nIf none of these solutions work or if you'd like further assistance, please provide me with the code and any additional information that may be helpful in understanding the issue.",
