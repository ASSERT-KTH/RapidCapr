    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. Unfortunately, without seeing the actual implementation it is difficult to provide a specific solution. \n\nHowever, the fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there might be a performance issue within the code. One potential solution is to optimize the algorithm being used in the function to be more efficient.\n\nIf you could provide the actual implementation and any further information about the specific use case in question, I would be happy to assist further in identifying the root cause of the performance issue and providing a solution.",
