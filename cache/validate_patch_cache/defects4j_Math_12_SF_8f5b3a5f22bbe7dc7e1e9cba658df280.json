    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. Without the specific code, it's difficult for me to provide an exact fix, but here are some general suggestions to address the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Ensure that the code does not have any infinite loops or recursive function calls that cause it to run indefinitely.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If the input size is too large, it might be beneficial to optimize the code by using more efficient algorithms and data structures.\n\n3. Parallelize the code: If the code can be parallelized, consider using parallel programming techniques to improve performance.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value: If none of the above options are possible, consider increasing the timeout value to allow the code more time to run.",
