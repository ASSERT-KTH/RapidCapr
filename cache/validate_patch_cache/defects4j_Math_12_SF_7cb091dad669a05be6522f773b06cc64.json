    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it's likely that the code has a performance issue that needs to be addressed. Without seeing the code and understanding its context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution.\n\nHowever, some possible approaches to address performance issues would be to optimize the algorithm by reducing the number of loops or computations, optimizing data structures, or finding more efficient ways to perform necessary operations.\n\nIf the performance issue is related to slow I/O operations, such as reading from a file, you could try optimizing that aspect of the code as well.\n\nAnother approach would be to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve them incrementally, or to use parallel processing to distribute the workload across multiple cores or nodes.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the performance issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
