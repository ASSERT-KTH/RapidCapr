    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a correct function that addresses the timeout issue. However, a general tip for addressing timeout issues is to analyze the algorithm used and optimize it if possible. Sometimes optimizing the code structure, using more efficient data structures, or reducing unnecessary computations can help to improve performance and avoid timeouts.\n\nIf you provide me with more information about the code and the specific algorithm being used, I may be able to provide more specific guidance.",
