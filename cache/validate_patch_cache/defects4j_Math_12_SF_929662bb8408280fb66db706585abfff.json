    "patch": "I apologize for the continued inconvenience. Without seeing the code itself, it is difficult to provide a specific solution, but here are some general tips to help debug and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Look for any loops in the code that may not be terminating and causing the timeout error. Ensure that all loops have proper termination conditions.\n\n2. Optimize the code: The timeout error could be caused by inefficiencies in the code. Consider optimizing the code by using more efficient algorithms, data structures or simplifying the logic.\n\n3. Use debugging tools: Use debugging tools to identify which part of the code is causing the timeout error. This could help locate the exact part and provide a clue to the cause of the error.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit: If none of the above options work, consider increasing the timeout limit to give the code more time to execute. However, this should be done as a last resort as it may not fix the underlying issue.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code and the specific test case, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. I recommend reviewing the code and the error message to identify the cause of the timeout error.",
