    "patch": "Without seeing the code and understanding the context, it is difficult to provide a correct function. However, based on the error message, it seems like the issue is related to the test timing out. Here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Check the performance of the function being tested. If the code takes too long to execute, consider optimizing it to improve performance.\n2. Check the test setup. If the test requires a lot of setup, it may be taking too long to execute. Consider refactoring the test setup to make it more efficient.\n3. Increase the timeout value of the test. If the test is expected to take longer than the default timeout value, you can increase it by adding the `timeout` parameter to the `@Test` annotation like this: `@Test(timeout = 900000)`. This will increase the timeout to 900 seconds (15 minutes).\n4. Divide the test into smaller tests. If the test is covering too much ground, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused tests. This will make it easier to pinpoint the issue if a test fails.",
