    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect fix. Since the test is still timing out, it's possible that the issue is with performance rather than a bug in the code.\n\nHere are some possible optimizations you can try to improve the performance of the function:\n\n1. Avoid redundant calculations - If the function is performing the same calculation multiple times, try to cache the results instead of recalculating every time.\n\n2. Try a different algorithm - If the current algorithm is too slow, consider using a more efficient algorithm that achieves the same result.\n\n3. Optimize data structures - If the function is manipulating large data sets, consider using more efficient data structures such as hash tables or binary trees.\n\nWithout seeing the actual code, it's hard to provide a more specific fix. However, I hope these tips are helpful in improving the performance of the function.",
