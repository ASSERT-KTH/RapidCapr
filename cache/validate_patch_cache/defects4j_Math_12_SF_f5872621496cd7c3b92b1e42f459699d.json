    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like there might be a performance issue in the code. Without seeing the code and the full test suite, it is hard to provide a working solution in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, I suggest you try the following steps to optimize the performance of the code:\n\n1. Check for any unnecessary loops and nested loops that can be eliminated or break out early.\n2. Review any recursive functions that could benefit from better memoization or dynamic programming techniques.\n3. Ensure that there are no infinite loops or deadlocks in the code.\n4. Optimize any memory-intensive operations, such as large object instantiations, by breaking them apart or reducing their size.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide more information about the code and the test suite so I can assist you further.",
