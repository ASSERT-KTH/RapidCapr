    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code or knowing what it does, it is difficult for me to provide a solution that would correct the issue causing the timeout error. However, here are some general tips that may help you optimize your code and make it run more efficiently:\n\n1. Analyze the algorithm's complexity: Analyze the time complexity of your code. Frequency analysis can give you insight into your program's performance bottlenecks. Use math libraries to make calculations more efficient.\n\n2. Think about the code structure: Are there any redundant code lines? Are there any loops that are unnecessary?\n\n3. Optimize loops: Can a loop be unrolled? Can the loop be optimized using directional shift operators or smart pointers?\n\n4. Optimize function calls: Are there any common operations that can be factored out into a single function?\n\n5. Avoid dynamic allocation: Dynamic allocation can use a lot of resources. Instead, use stack-based allocation or object pools.\n\nIf none of the above tips help solve your issue, please provide me with further details so that I can assist you better.",
