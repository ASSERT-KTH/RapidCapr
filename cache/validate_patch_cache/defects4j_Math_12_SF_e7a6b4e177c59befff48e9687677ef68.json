    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation or understanding the underlying issue, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function.\n\nHere are some general strategies that could help address the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Optimize the algorithm if possible to reduce the computation time and improve performance. Eliminate any unnecessary loops or variables, consider using a more efficient data structure, or try to identify bottlenecks or redundant calculations.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: Parallelizing the code can help to reduce the execution time by distributing the workload across multiple processors or threads. Consider using libraries like Java's Executor framework or parallel streams.\n\n3. Use caching: If the computation involves repeated calculations of the same function with the same input, consider caching the results to avoid redundant computations.\n\n4. Use specialized libraries: For complex computations, consider using specialized libraries that provide optimized algorithms and data structures.\n\n5. Re-architect the code: If the code has fundamental design issues that cannot be resolved through optimization or parallelization, consider re-architecting the code to better align with the problem domain.\n\nAgain, I apologize for not being able to provide a specific solution to this problem. I hope these general strategies help you in finding and fixing the issue.",
