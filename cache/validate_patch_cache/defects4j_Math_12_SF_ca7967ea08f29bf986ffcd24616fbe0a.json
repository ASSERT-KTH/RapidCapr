    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the error. It is possible that there is an issue with the code itself or with the test environment. \n\nIn general, if a test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the code is taking a long time to execute. One possible solution is to optimize the code or use more efficient algorithms to decrease the execution time of the code.\n\nAnother possible solution is to increase the timeout duration for the test. However, this should be done with caution, as excessively long tests can lead to decreased productivity in the testing process.\n\nIf you could provide more information or the actual code, I could provide a more specific and accurate solution.",
