    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix didn't work either. Given that the code is timing out, there might be some performance issues with the current implementation.\n\nWithout the full code, it's difficult for me to provide a new implementation. However, I can suggest some general strategies to improve performance:\n\n1. Check for unnecessary loops or calculations: Make sure that you're not looping or calculating unnecessary values.\n\n2. Optimize the data structures: Use the appropriate data structure that is efficient as per your requirement.\n\n3. Use cache: Use a cache to avoid re-calculating values that have already been computed.\n\n4. Divide and conquer: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve them individually.\n\n5. Parallelize the code: If possible, parallelize the code to take advantage of multiple cores.\n\nI hope these strategies help you in optimizing the code and fixing the timeout issue.",
