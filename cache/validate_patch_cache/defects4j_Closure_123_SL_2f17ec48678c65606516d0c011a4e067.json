Based on the error message you provided, it seems like the issue might be related to a missing bracket or semicolon in the previous lines. In order to provide the correct line at the infill location, I would need to see more of the code surrounding the buggy line.\n\nHowever, if the issue is related to illegal start of type, the cause might be that the buggy line is in a wrong location or context, or it might not be necessary for the code. Please share more of the code so I can give a more accurate answer.",
