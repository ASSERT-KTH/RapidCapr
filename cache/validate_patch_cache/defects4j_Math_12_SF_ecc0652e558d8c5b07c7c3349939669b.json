It's difficult to provide a solution without seeing the original code. \n\nRegarding the timeout issue, it's possible that the function is taking too long to execute. One solution could be to optimize the code to reduce its execution time. Another solution could be to increase the timeout limit for the test.\n\nWithout the code, I cannot provide a specific solution. If you could provide more information or the code itself, I would be happy to help.",
