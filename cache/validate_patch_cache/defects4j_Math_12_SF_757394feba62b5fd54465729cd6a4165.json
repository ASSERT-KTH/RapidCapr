    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 10 minutes (600 seconds), it's likely that there is still something wrong with the implementation that is causing it to take too much time to complete. Without seeing the full implementation and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some general strategies for optimizing code to reduce execution time:\n\n1. Use more efficient algorithms and data structures: Depending on the problem, there may be more efficient algorithms or data structures available to solve it. For example, using a binary search tree instead of a linear search can significantly reduce execution time.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary computations: Make sure that the code is only running the necessary computations, for the input parameters requested. Avoid running any loops or calculations that don't affect the output of the code.\n\n3. Optimize loops and conditionals: Whenever possible, try to minimize the number of iterations in loops or conditionals. For example, consider using a while loop instead of a for loop when the number of iterations is variable.\n\n4. Parallelize: If the code has independent computations that can be run independently, consider parallelizing them to run on multiple cores or machines simultaneously. This can significantly reduce overall execution time.\n\n5. Profile the code: Use a profiler tool to identify any bottlenecks or areas of code that are taking a long time to execute. Once these areas are identified, they can often be optimized to reduce execution time. \n\nI recommend trying some of these approaches to optimize the implementation before attempting to modify or rewrite the code.",
