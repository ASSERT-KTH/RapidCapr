    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code and understanding the problem, it's difficult to provide a correct solution. \n\nHowever, based on the timeout error, it appears that the function is taking too long to execute, possibly due to an inefficient algorithm or an infinite loop. \n\nI suggest analyzing the code and identifying any potential bottleneck areas or infinite loops, and optimizing the code accordingly. If you are still having trouble, consider reaching out to a software developer or seeking help from a forum or online community dedicated to solving programming problems.",
