Here is an updated solution:\n\n```Java\nprotected BasePeriod(long duration) {\n    this(duration * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L, PeriodType.standard().withMillisRemoved(), null);\n}\n```\n\nThe problem with the previous solutions was that they did not correctly handle weeks as a unit of time. This solution takes the duration in weeks and converts it to milliseconds before passing it to the `BasePeriod` constructor. The `PeriodType.standard().withMillisRemoved()` removes any sub-second duration information from the period, and the `null` parameter for the chronology uses the default chronology. This solution should fix the test failure you experienced.",
