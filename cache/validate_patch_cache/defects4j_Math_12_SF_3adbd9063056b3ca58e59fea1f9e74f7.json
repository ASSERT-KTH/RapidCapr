Since there is a compilation time out error and I can't see the code, I cannot provide the correct function. \n\nHowever, here are some general tips for dealing with compilation time out errors:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or recursive functions that may be causing the time out.\n2. Look for inefficient algorithms or data structures that might be causing excessive computation time.\n3. Consider splitting the problematic code into smaller functions or using threading to parallelize the computation.\n4. Check if there are any external factors, such as a slow network connection or slow hardware, that might be contributing to the time out.",
