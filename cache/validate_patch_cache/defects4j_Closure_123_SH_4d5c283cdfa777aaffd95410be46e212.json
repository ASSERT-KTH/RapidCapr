Based on the error and test case you provided, it seems that the issue is not related to the `hasExceptionHandler` method.\n\nWithout further information, it is difficult to provide a specific corrective hunk. It's possible that there is a missing or mismatched bracket or semicolon elsewhere in the code. Please provide additional context if possible, such as the full source code, the test case file, or any other messages that may help identify the location and cause of the error.",
