As the code is not provided, I cannot provide the correct function for you.\n\nIn general, a timeout error indicates that the program is taking too long to execute, and the test is terminated after a certain amount of time. There are a few strategies that can be used to address timeout errors:\n\n1. Optimize the code: This involves reviewing the code to identify and remove any unnecessary or redundant operations that may be causing the program to run slower than necessary.\n\n2. Reduce the size of input data: If the program is processing or analyzing large amounts of data, reducing the size of the input data can help to speed up the program.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value: If the program is taking longer to execute because it requires more processing time, increasing the timeout value can allow the program to complete without being terminated prematurely.\n\n4. Parallelization or distribution: Sometimes if the application code is too slow, then an alternate approach could be to speed up the code by distributing or running it in parallel on multiple processors. \n\nIn any case, providing the code snippet will allow me to assist you better in solving the issue.",
