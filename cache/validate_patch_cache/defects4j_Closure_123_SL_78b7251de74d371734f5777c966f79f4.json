Without having access to the full code or surrounding context, it's difficult for me to provide the correct code.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it appears that the issue might not be related to the infill location or the statement that was removed earlier. It is likely caused by a syntax error or illegal use of a keyword earlier in the code.\n\nCan you please provide me with the full code or the code snippet surrounding the infill location where the statement was removed? This will allow me to better understand the context and provide a more accurate solution to the issue.",
