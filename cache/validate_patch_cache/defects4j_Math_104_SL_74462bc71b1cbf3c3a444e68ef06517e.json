Without additional context, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution for the problem you are facing.\n\nRegarding the compilation error you mentioned, it occurs when the Java compiler encounters a file that does not consist solely of correct Java class, interface, or enumeration declarations. This means that there may be an issue with the overall structure of the file or with a specific declaration within the file.\n\nTo provide a correct line at the infill location, I will need more information about the code and where the error occurs. Can you please provide more context, such as the code surrounding the infill location and the specific error message that you received?\n\nOnce we have more information, I can give you a more accurate solution.",
