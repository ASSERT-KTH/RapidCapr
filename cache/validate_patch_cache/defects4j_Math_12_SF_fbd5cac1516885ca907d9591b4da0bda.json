    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work for you. Without the code snippet, it's hard to say what might be causing the timeout error. However, I can provide you with a general strategy to debug and fix the code.\n\n1. Enable verbose output to see what parts of the code are taking the most time.\n\n2. Use a profiler to identify potential bottlenecks in the code. Profilers can help you pinpoint parts of the code that are taking a lot of time to execute.\n\n3. Break up the code into smaller, more manageable pieces and test each piece separately. This will help you identify where the issue is occurring.\n\n4. Optimize the code by using more efficient algorithms, data structures, or techniques. This may involve rewriting some parts of the code entirely.\n\n5. If all else fails, consider reaching out to other developers or posting on forums to get help from the community.\n\nWithout the code and more details, it's hard to provide a more specific solution.",
