Without seeing the code causing the compilation error, I cannot provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, a compilation error typically means that there is a syntax or type error in the code that prevents it from being compiled and executed. It may help to carefully review and debug the code, check for typos or missing semicolons, and ensure that all variable types and method signatures are correct.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code causing the compilation error, I can offer a more specific solution.",
