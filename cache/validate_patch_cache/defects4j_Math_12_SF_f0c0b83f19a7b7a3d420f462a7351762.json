    "patch": "This error indicates that the test is taking too long to complete and is timing out after 600 seconds. There could be several reasons why the test is taking so long, such as inefficient algorithms or large data sets.\n\nOne possible fix is to optimize the code to reduce its complexity and improve its runtime performance. This could include using more efficient algorithms and data structures, minimizing loops and unnecessary computations, and optimizing I/O operations.\n\nAnother option is to split the test into smaller sub-tests that can be performed more quickly and selectively identify the parts of the code that are causing the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
