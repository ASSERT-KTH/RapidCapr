    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without knowing the full code or having more information about the problem, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, if the test is timing out it might be due to a performance issue in the code. Here are a few recommendations that could potentially improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. If the test is dealing with large data sets, consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms. For example, using a hash table instead of a linear search can greatly improve performance.\n\n2. Avoid iterating through large data sets multiple times. If possible, try to combine multiple iterations into a single one.\n\n3. Consider using parallel processing if the test is dealing with a computationally intensive task. Parallel processing can help distribute the workload across multiple threads or processors, speeding up the execution.\n\n4. Look for any unnecessary computations or operations that can be eliminated. Sometimes optimizing the logic of the code can provide a significant performance boost.\n\n5. Some tests might be sending excessive requests to an external service. In this case, consider caching the response or using mock objects to avoid calling the service multiple times.\n\nI hope this can guide you towards a solution for the problem. If you provide additional information or code, I can provide a more specific recommendation.",
