    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without access to the full code, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, it seems that the code may be taking too long to execute and is causing the test to timeout. \n\nHere are a few strategies to reduce the execution time of the code:\n\n1. Reduce computation complexity: Try to simplify the code and reduce the number and frequency of complex calculations. Use efficient data structures and algorithms.\n\n2. Remove unnecessary code: Remove any code that is unnecessary or not used. This can include unused imports, unused variables, or unused functions.\n\n3. Parallelize the execution: Consider parallelizing the code to run on multiple threads or processors. This can be done using multi-threading or distributed computing frameworks.\n\n4. Optimize I/O: If the code performs a lot of I/O operations, consider optimizing these operations to minimize the time spent reading and writing data.\n\nOnce the code has been optimized, it should execute faster and the test should no longer have a timeout error.",
