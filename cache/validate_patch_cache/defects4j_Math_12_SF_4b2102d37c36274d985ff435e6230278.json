    "patch": "I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. Without access to the code causing the compilation error, I'm unable to provide a specific fix.\n\nHowever, in general, if a test is timing out after 600 seconds, it likely indicates there is a performance issue in the code being tested. This may be due to inefficient algorithms, large input sizes, or other factors. \n\nTo resolve the compilation error, you may need to optimize the code being tested to improve its performance. Alternatively, you could modify the test threshold to allow for a longer period of time before timing out. But this may be only a temporary fix and may not address the underlying issue. \n\nIf you could provide me with more specific information or access to the code causing the issue, I'd be happy to offer further guidance.",
