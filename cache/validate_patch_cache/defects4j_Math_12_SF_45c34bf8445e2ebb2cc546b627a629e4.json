    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Check that there are no infinite loops in the code that could cause the test to time out. Make sure that the code is handling the necessary input parameters and returning the correct output values.\n\n2. If the test case involves very large input data, the algorithm may take a long time to run. In this case, you could try optimizing the performance of the algorithm, or increasing the timeout value of the test.\n\n3. Check that the test case is not relying on external dependencies, such as network connectivity or file I/O. These dependencies could cause the test to fail or time out.\n\n4. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you could consider seeking assistance from other developers or posting a question on a relevant forum or community.",
