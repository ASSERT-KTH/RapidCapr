    "patch": "It seems like the timeout error is caused by a test that is taking too long to complete. Without more information on the code and the test suite, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some possible ways to address the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check if there are any time-consuming operations that can be optimized or function calls that can be replaced with more efficient alternatives. This may involve refactoring the code to improve its performance.\n\n2. Parallelize the tests: If there are multiple independent test cases, consider running them in parallel. This can save time and reduce the likelihood of a timeout error.\n\n3. Increase the timeout threshold: Depending on your testing framework, you should be able to increase the timeout threshold for individual tests. This will give the tests more time to complete before timing out.\n\n4. Divide the test suite: If the entire suite is timing out, consider dividing it into smaller suites and running them separately. This can help to identify which tests are causing the problem and may reveal any underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nWithout more information on the code and the test suite, it's difficult to provide an exact solution.",
