    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that did not work for you. Please try the following efficient implementation:\n \n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    double maxElement = distribution[0];\n    int maxElementIndex = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        sum += distribution[i];\n        if (distribution[i] > maxElement) {\n            maxElement = distribution[i];\n            maxElementIndex = i;\n        }\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    \n    if (sum > 0) {\n        double invSum = 1d / sum;\n        for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n            normalized[i] = distribution[i] * invSum;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if (sum == 0) {\n        normalized[maxElementIndex] = 1d;\n    }\n    \n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the cases of a null input array as well as an input array where all the values are 0. \n\nThe implementation first calculates the sum of the elements in the array and also finds the maximum element in the array. If the sum is greater than 0, it calculates the inverse of the sum and then normalizes each element by multiplying it with the inverse of the sum. If the sum is equal to 0, it sets the maximum element to 1 and rest to 0.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
