    "patch": "I apologize for the issue you encountered. Without being able to see the code, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution, but I can suggest some general strategies to address the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that your code doesn't contain any loops or recursion that could run indefinitely. \n2. Optimize the code: If the code runs slowly due to inefficient algorithms or data structures, consider optimizing it. \n3. Simplify the inputs: If the code performs well on small inputs but not on large ones, try to simplify the inputs to reduce the execution time. \n4. Use parallel processing: If the code performs a lot of calculations that can be parallelized, consider using parallel processing to speed up the execution.",
