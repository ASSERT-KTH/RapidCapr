    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the code is taking too long to execute or is stuck in an infinite loop. Without seeing the full code and test cases, it's difficult to provide a specific fix.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips to improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Check if there is a more efficient way to solve the problem. Look at the time complexity and try to optimize it as much as possible.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the input is too large, try reducing it to a smaller size to see if the test passes. This can help to identify the bottleneck in the code.\n\n3. Use parallel processing: If the code is performing a large number of calculations, consider using parallel processing to speed up the execution time.\n\n4. Implement memoization: If the code is doing repeated calculations, use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n5. Use efficient data structures: Ensure that the data structures used in the code are efficient and suit the problem being solved.\n\nIf the issue persists, you may need to consult with the authors of the code to get assistance in identifying the bug and optimizing the code further.",
