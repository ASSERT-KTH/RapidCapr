Here's a possible solution that should be more efficient:\n\n```Java\npublic static double[] getDistributionClone(double[] p, int n) {\n    if (p == null || p.length == 0 || n <= 0) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    double[] q = new double[n];\n    q[0] = p[0];\n\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        double pi = p[i % p.length];\n        q[i] = q[i - 1] + pi;\n    }\n\n    return q;\n}\n```\n\nThis solution should correctly calculate the distribution and should not time out on the provided test case. However, please let me know if there are any further issues.",
