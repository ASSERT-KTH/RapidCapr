    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without more information or context, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to prevent test timeout errors:\n\n1. Optimize the code: If the code is taking too long to execute, you can optimize the algorithm or simplify the code to reduce the execution time.\n\n2. Use smaller test data: If the input data is very large, it can cause the test to take a long time to execute. You can try using smaller test data or optimizing the test data to reduce the execution time.\n\n3. Increase the timeout: You can increase the timeout limit for the test. Depending on the testing framework you are using, you can set the timeout limit in the test runner or in the test suite.\n\n4. Use parallel execution: If possible, you can run the tests in parallel using multiple threads to reduce the total execution time.\n\nAgain, without more context or information, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. I suggest following the suggestions above and analyzing the test and code carefully to identify the specific issue and address it accordingly.",
