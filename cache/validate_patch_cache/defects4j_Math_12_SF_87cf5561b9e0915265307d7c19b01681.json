    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code snippet and knowing more about the code, I cannot provide a definitive solution to the problem. However, the error message you provided suggests that the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out. Here are a few suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check if there is an infinite loop in the code or if the code is performing an extensive operation that may take a long time to execute. If so, try to optimize the code to reduce its execution time.\n2. Check if there is a problem with the test itself. Perhaps it is waiting for an input that is never provided or performing an operation that is too complex. Review the test and ensure that it is well-designed and efficient.\n3. Check your environment. The error message may be indicating that there is a problem with the platform or environment running the test. In this case, try running the test in a different environment.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more information about the code and the test so that I may be better able to assist you.",
