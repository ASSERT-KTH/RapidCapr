    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like the fixed version I provided earlier was still not optimized for performance.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general suggestions that might help:\n\n- Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures to reduce the time complexity of your code.\n- Avoid repetitive calculations by storing intermediate results in variables or data structures.\n- Check your loops and conditions to ensure that they are not causing the program to get stuck in an infinite loop or performing excessive calculations.\n- If possible, try to break the problem down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently and then combined to solve the larger problem.\n\nIf you can provide more information or the code you are working with, I would be happy to try to provide a more specific solution.",
