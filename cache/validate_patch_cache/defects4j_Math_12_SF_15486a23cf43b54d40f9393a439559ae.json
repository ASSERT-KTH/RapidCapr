    "patch": "I apologize for that. The timeout error suggests that there is an issue with the performance of the code. Without seeing the code and the context, it is difficult to give an accurate solution. However, here are some general tips for improving performance:\n\n1. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.\n2. Avoid unnecessary computation, loops, and recursion.\n3. Optimize I/O operations and network requests.\n4. Use caching and memoization when appropriate.\n5. Parallelize computations whenever possible.\n6. Profile and analyze your code to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n\nThese tips should help you improve the performance of your code. If you still face issues, please provide the code and the context so I can assist you in finding a specific solution.",
