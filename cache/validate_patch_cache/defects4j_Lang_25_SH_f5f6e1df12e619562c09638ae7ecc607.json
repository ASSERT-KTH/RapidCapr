    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake. Based on the new information, it seems that there is still an issue with the code. \n\nWithout seeing more detailed information such as the code snippet surrounding the infill location or the full error message, it is difficult to provide a specific hunk to correct the issue.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that there may be an issue with an assignment statement where an operand is expected but not present. For example, if you have something like `a =`, where `=` is the error token, this error might occur. Double-check your code around the infill location to see if there are any incomplete assignments or other syntax errors.\n\nIf you can provide more information such as the code snippet or the full error message, I may be able to provide more specific guidance to help resolve the issue.",
