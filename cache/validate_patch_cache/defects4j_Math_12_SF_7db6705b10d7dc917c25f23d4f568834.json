    "patch": "I'm sorry for the confusion. Since the code is not given, I cannot provide a complete solution for the error you're facing. However, here are some suggestions you can try to resolve the error:\n\n1. Check if your test case is stuck in an infinite loop.\n2. Check if your test case is taking too long to execute. In that case, you can try optimizing your code.\n3. Increase the timeout limit for your test case. For example, if your test case is timing out after 600 seconds, you can try increasing the timeout to 1200 seconds or more.\n4. Check if there are any resources that are not being properly released by your code, leading to the test case timing out.\n5. Try running your test case on a different machine or environment to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of the above suggestions work, please provide the code you are working with, and I will try to provide a more specific solution.",
