    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not work. Since I do not have access to the code and the error message indicates a timeout, it is possible that there is a performance issue or an infinite loop in the function.\n\nWithout more information about the code and its intended functionality, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, here are a few general approaches that could help to mitigate performance issues:\n\n1. Use more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n2. Limit the input size of the function to prevent it from taking too long.\n3. Add timeouts or cancellation logic to exit the function if it takes too long.\n4. Debug the function to identify any infinite loops or other performance bottlenecks.\n\nIf you can provide more information or code snippets, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
