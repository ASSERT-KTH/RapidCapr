Without seeing the code that is causing the timeout error, I cannot provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips to help optimize your code and avoid timeouts:\n\n1. Use more efficient algorithms to process the data, such as binary search, dynamic programming, or memoization.\n2. Reduce the amount of data being processed by filtering or partitioning it.\n3. Use parallel processing or multiprocessing to distribute the workload among multiple CPU cores.\n4. Implement caching or memoization to avoid re-computing the same results multiple times.\n5. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize them.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code causing the timeout error, I can offer a more specific solution.",
