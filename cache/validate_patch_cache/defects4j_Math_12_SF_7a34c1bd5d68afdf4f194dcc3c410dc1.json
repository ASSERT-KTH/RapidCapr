    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts not resolving the issue. Unfortunately, without seeing the code or knowing the requirements, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix.\n\nHowever, a test timing out after 600 seconds indicates that the code is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized. Here are a few possible solutions to consider:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Try to make the code more efficient. Review the algorithms being used and refactor if necessary. Consider using caching, memoization, or other techniques to reduce computation.\n\n2. Reduce the size of data: The test may be timing out due to large input data. Try to reduce the size of the data being processed and see if that helps.\n\n3. Split the computation: If the computation being performed is very complex, then it may be possible to split it into smaller parts and run them in parallel. This can help reduce the overall execution time.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above options work, you might consider increasing the timeout limit to give the code more time to execute.\n\nSince I am unable to view the code, it is difficult for me to give more specific advice.",
