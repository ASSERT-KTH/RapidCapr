    "patch": "I apologize for the previous failures. Without the code and test implementation, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, I can provide you with a general approach to find the cause of the problem.\n\nFirst, check the console output for any error messages or stack traces that may provide more information about the issue. If the test is timing out, it indicates that the computation is taking too long to complete. \n\nYou can try to optimize the function by checking for any performance bottlenecks. Some optimization strategies you can try include:\n\n1. Analyzing the algorithm complexity, and identify any linear or nested loops that can be optimized or simplified.\n2. Avoiding creating large data structures or objects that can cause memory issues or slow down the computation.\n3. Using more efficient data structures, algorithms or caching mechanisms to improve the performance.\n4. Parallelizing the computation if possible, by using threads or other libraries.\n5. Identifying any database or file operations that could cause I/O delays and avoid them whenever possible.\n6. Using profiling tools or debuggers to identify any performance bottlenecks in the function.\n\nOnce you have identified the performance issue, apply any necessary changes to the implementation to improve the performance and try running the test again. \n\nIf the issue persists, verify that the test itself is valid and the expected result is correct. You can do this by manually analyzing the input and output data in the test and comparing it to the expected outcome. \n\nI hope this helps. If you provide additional information or code, I will be happy to assist you further in correcting the issue.",
