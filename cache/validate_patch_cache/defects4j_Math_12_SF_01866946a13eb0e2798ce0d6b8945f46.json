    "patch": "The `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error typically indicates that the program is taking too long to execute. Considering this, I would need more information to understand the source of the error. Specifically, what is the function supposed to do and how is it being tested?\n\nIf the function is a complex algorithm or performs a large number of operations, it may be normal for it to take a while to execute. However, if the function is not achieving the expected results given the input values, it may be necessary to review the implementation and identify areas for optimization.\n\nWithout additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific solution to the error. Please provide more details about the function and how it is being tested so I can help you further.",
