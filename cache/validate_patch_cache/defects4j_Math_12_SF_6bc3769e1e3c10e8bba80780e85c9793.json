    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code or knowing the specific error message, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, here are some general tips on how to handle a timed out test:\n\n1. Increase the timeout period if possible. Some test frameworks allow you to set a longer timeout period, which may give the code more time to complete the test.\n\n2. Identify the specific part of the code that is causing the timeout. Depending on the complexity of the code, it may be possible to narrow down the problem to a specific function or section.\n\n3. Optimize the code to improve its performance. This could involve identifying and removing redundant or inefficient code, optimizing loops, or utilizing data structures that are better suited to the task at hand.\n\n4. Check for resource constraints. It's possible that the code is running out of memory or other system resources, which could be causing the timeout. Make sure that the code is properly managing resources and not generating memory leaks.\n\n5. Consider rewriting the code from scratch. If all else fails, it may be necessary to rewrite the code from scratch, taking care to avoid the performance issues that led to the timeout.",
