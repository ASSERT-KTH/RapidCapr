    "patch": "It is difficult to provide a correct function without more information about the problem and the code. However, here are some steps to help you identify and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check if the function is taking too long to execute and causing the test to time out. If that is the case, optimize the function or use a different algorithm to improve its performance.\n\n2. Check if the function is allocating too much memory and causing the test to fail. If that is the case, optimize the memory usage or use a different data structure to reduce the memory footprint.\n\n3. Check the inputs and outputs of the function, and make sure they are correct. Use a debugger or print statements to trace the execution of the code and verify that the function is behaving as expected.\n\n4. Check the dependencies of the function, and make sure they are installed and configured correctly. If the function relies on external libraries or services, ensure that they are up-to-date and running properly.\n\nOnce you have identified the issue, you can make the necessary changes to fix the function and pass the test.",
