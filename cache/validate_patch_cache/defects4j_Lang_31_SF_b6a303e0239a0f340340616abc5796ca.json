The problem with the failing test case is that it contains supplementary Unicode characters, which require more than one `char` in Java, but were not being handled properly by the original implementation. The updated implementation handles supplementary Unicode characters by checking for high surrogate characters and combining them with the next character to form the full code point. \n\nI hope this resolves the issue. Please let me know if you have any further concerns.",
