    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. A timeout error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute, and there are a few things that could cause this:\n\n1. The algorithm is inefficient and takes too long to complete.\n2. There is an infinite loop or recursion in the code.\n3. There is an issue with input validation, causing the function to become stuck in an unintended loop or operation.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to identify the exact cause of the issue. However, there are a few techniques you can use to improve the function's performance:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm by using more efficient data structures and algorithms or caching values and reducing redundant calculations.\n2. Avoid using nested loops where possible, as these can cause the function to become very slow with larger inputs.\n3. Use iterative algorithms instead of recursive ones, as these can be more efficient in many cases.\n4. Use debugging tools such as log statements or breakpoints to identify the exact point where the function is getting stuck.\n\nIf you provide me with more details about the code and the specific error messages, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
