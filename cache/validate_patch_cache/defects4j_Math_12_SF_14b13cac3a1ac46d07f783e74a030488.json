    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the exact issue. However, given the compilation error, it's likely that there is a performance issue with the function.\n\nHere are some general tips to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the function - Look for any inefficiencies in the code and try to optimize them. This could include using better algorithms, optimizing loops, or using more efficient data structures.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops - Look for any loops that are not correctly terminating and causing the function to get stuck.\n\n3. Use debugging tools - Try using profiling tools to identify where the function is spending most of its time, and optimize those sections of code.\n\n4. Simplify the function - If the function is too complex, consider simplifying it or breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n\n5. Increase the available resources - If none of the above options work, consider increasing the resources available to the function, such as additional memory or processing power.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
