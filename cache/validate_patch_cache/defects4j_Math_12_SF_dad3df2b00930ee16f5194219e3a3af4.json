    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous suggestion did not work. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. The test timing out after 600 seconds could be a sign of an infinite loop or inefficient code that is not terminating in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nHere are a few things you could try to further investigate and solve the issue:\n\n1. Check if the test is indeed taking a long time to complete or has gone into an infinite loop. You could do this by adding additional print statements or debug logs to the code to determine where it is getting stuck.\n\n2. If the issue is due to inefficient code, you could try to optimize the code by using more efficient algorithms or data structures, reducing the number of iterations, or avoiding unnecessary computations.\n\n3. Another option would be to split the test into smaller, more manageable tests. This would help you isolate the issue and make it easier to pinpoint where the problem lies.\n\nIf you are still having difficulties resolving the issue, please provide the code, and I would be happy to take a look and help you further.",
