Based on the test error you provided, it seems that the issue is not with the implementation of the `isEmptyType()` method, but rather with the code that is being tested. Specifically, the test expects a warning to be generated but none is being generated.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix is likely not in the `isEmptyType()` method, but in the test code itself. I would recommend investigating the code being tested and the conditions under which warnings are generated, and making sure that those conditions are being met in the test. It's possible that there is an issue with the test setup or execution that is preventing the warning from being generated.\n\nIf you provide more information about the code being tested and the conditions under which warnings are generated, I may be able to provide more specific guidance on how to fix the test.",
