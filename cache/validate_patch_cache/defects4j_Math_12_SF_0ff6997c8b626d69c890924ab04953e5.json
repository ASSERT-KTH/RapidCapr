    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not fixing the issue. Without more information on the specific code and test being run, it's difficult to provide a solution that addresses the timeout error.\n\nBased on the error message, it seems that the test is taking longer than the allowed time to run. This could be caused by a variety of factors, such as slow or inefficient code, too many tests running in parallel, or insufficient computing resources.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code being tested. If the code itself is slow or inefficient, it can cause tests to take longer than expected. Consider using profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the code where possible.\n\n2. Check the test environment. Ensure that the environment in which the test is being run has sufficient resources (e.g. CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the workload. Additionally, consider whether other processes or tests running on the same machine could be interfering with the test.\n\n3. Limit the parallelism of tests. If too many tests are running in parallel, it could cause resource contention and lead to timeouts. Consider limiting the number of tests that can run at once, or grouping tests based on their resource requirements.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit for the test. Depending on the specific situation, it may be appropriate to increase the timeout limit for the test to give it more time to complete.\n\nIf providing the actual code, more context, and detailed error message, I may able to provide a more specific solution.",
