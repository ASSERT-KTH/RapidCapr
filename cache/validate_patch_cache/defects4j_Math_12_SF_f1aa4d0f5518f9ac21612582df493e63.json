    "patch": "It seems that the issue is still related to the execution time of the function. One possible solution is to optimize the function by using more efficient algorithms or data structures. However, without access to the full code and context of the problem, it's difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHere are some general tips on optimizing code:\n- Use appropriate data structures to store and access data efficiently.\n- Avoid running unnecessary computation or loops.\n- Combine operations where possible to reduce the number of operations needed.\n- Implement specialized algorithms that are efficient for the specific problem you are trying to solve.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the task and the code that run on the test that times out, I could look into it further and provide a more specific solution.",
