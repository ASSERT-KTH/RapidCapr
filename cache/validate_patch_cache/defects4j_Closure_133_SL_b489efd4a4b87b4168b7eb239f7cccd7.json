    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Based on the error messages you provided, it seems that the issue is not with the infill location you mentioned, but with the `jsdocParser.parse()` method. Without seeing the full code and understanding the context, it's difficult to provide an accurate fix. However, I can suggest a few potential solutions:\n\n1. Check if the `jsdocParser.parse()` method is called in the correct way. Make sure that all the required parameters are passed to it, and that they have valid values.\n\n2. Look at the error message: `JSC_TYPE_PARSE_ERROR. Bad type annotation. Unknown type T at externs line 11 : 14`. This suggests that there is a problem with a type annotation somewhere in the code. Check all the type annotations and make sure they are written correctly.\n\n3. Try running the failing test with `-ea` flag to enable assertions. The `IllegalStateException: Recorded bad position information` error could be caused by an assertion that failed, which could indicate another bug in the code.\n\n4. Check the `stream` object. If the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method returns `null` or unexpected values, it could cause the `parse()` method to fail. Make sure that the `stream` object is initialized correctly and that it contains the expected data. Also, check if there are any other methods that modify the `stream` object before calling the `parse()` method.\n\nAgain, these are just general suggestions based on the error messages you provided. Without more information, it's difficult to diagnose the exact issue.",
