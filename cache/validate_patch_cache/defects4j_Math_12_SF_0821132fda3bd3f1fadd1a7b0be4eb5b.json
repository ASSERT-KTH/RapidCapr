    "patch": "I apologize for the misunderstanding. Without seeing the code and the specific test case causing the timeout error, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, a common reason for code to time out is due to inefficient algorithms or excessive resource usage. Here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Optimize your algorithms: Make sure that your code is using the most efficient algorithms and data structures for the problem you are trying to solve.\n\n2. Reduce the size of your data: If your code is processing large amounts of data, consider breaking it up into smaller chunks or using techniques like parallel processing or distributed computing.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary work: Make sure that your code is not performing unnecessary work, such as redundant calculations or unnecessary I/O operations.\n\n4. Use caching: If your code is repeatedly processing the same data, consider using caching to save time and improve performance.\n\nIf you can provide me with more specific information about the code and the test case causing the timeout error, I can offer more specific advice.",
