    "patch": "It seems like there might be an issue with the performance of the function. Without knowing more about the implementation, it is difficult to suggest a specific fix, but here are a few suggestions that could potentially improve performance:\n\n1. Consider using a more efficient algorithm for computing the distribution clone. There may be ways to optimize the existing algorithm or find a better alternative algorithm altogether.\n\n2. Implement multi-threading or other concurrency techniques to parallelize the computation and speed up the execution time.\n\n3. Optimize memory usage by minimizing the creation of unnecessary objects and data structures.\n\n4. Reduce the size of the input data by removing any redundant or irrelevant information.\n\nPlease provide the code you're trying to improve so that I can help you better.",
