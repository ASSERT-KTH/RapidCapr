    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to determine the exact cause of the issue.\n\nHowever, to address the compilation error, it seems like the test is taking longer than the maximum time allowed which is 600 seconds. This can be an indication of an infinite loop or a performance issue in the code.\n\nI would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Review the code to look for any infinite loops or inefficient algorithms that could cause performance issues.\n2. Add print statements or debug the code to understand what is causing the delay.\n3. Try increasing the maximum time allowed for the test to complete if possible, but ensure that the test is not taking longer than necessary.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code, I may be able to provide more specific suggestions.",
