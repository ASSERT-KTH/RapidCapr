However, without seeing the code, I cannot provide a specific solution to the timeout error. \n\nThe error message indicates that the test is taking longer than 600 seconds to complete, which suggests that the issue is related to algorithmic complexity or possible infinite loops within the code. \n\nHere are some general tips to address the timeout error:\n- Review the code to see if there are any lengthy computations or inefficient loops that can be optimized.\n- Look for any parts of the code that might be causing infinite loops or recursion and fix them.\n- Consider breaking up the test into smaller, more manageable tests to narrow down the issue.\n- Increase the timeout value to a larger value if it is appropriate and does not affect the testing process.",
