Without seeing the entire code file, it's tough to say, but it looks like the infill location might be in the middle of a class definition.\n\nNevertheless, the line itself is correct, but there might be a syntax or structural problem around it. Please double-check if all the necessary class, interface, or enum definitions are closed and properly formatted.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide the entire code file or a larger section of it so that I can better understand the context of the bug and provide a more specific solution.",
