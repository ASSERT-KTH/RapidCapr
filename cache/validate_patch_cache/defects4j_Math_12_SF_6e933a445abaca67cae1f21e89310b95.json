Without the code for reference, I cannot provide the correct function. \n\nHowever, the compilation error you are experiencing may not be related to the code changes made. It could be due to external factors such as system resource constraints or issues with the testing framework. \n\nTo further troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Increase the timeout value for the test.\n2. Verify that the test is actually working as intended- if it is not, this could cause it to fail and exceed the timeout.\n3. Check the operating system's resource usage to ensure that there is enough memory available to run the test. \n\nIf none of these steps lead to a resolution, feel free to provide more information on the issue and I'll do my best to assist.",
