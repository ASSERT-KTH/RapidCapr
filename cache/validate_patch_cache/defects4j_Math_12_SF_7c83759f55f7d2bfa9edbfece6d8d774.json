    "patch": "It seems like there is a performance issue in the current version. Without seeing the code, I won't be able to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to improve performance:\n\n1. Check for loops: If there are any nested loops, look for ways to simplify or optimize them.\n\n2. Use efficient data structures: Choose data structures that allow efficient lookup and insertion, such as hash maps, trees, and arrays.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary calculations: If you are doing calculations that can be precomputed or reused, consider storing the results in a cache or memoizing the function.\n\n4. Use parallel processing: If the code is running on a multi-core machine, consider using parallel processing to speed up computations.\n\n5. Profile the code: Use a profiler to identify which parts of the code are taking the most time and focus on optimizing those sections.\n\nWithout more details on the code or the specific performance issue, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
