    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the specific code, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution to the problem. However, based on the error message, it seems that the function is taking too long to execute and is timing out. Here are some general tips to optimize the code and reduce the execution time: \n\n1. Avoid nested loops: If the function has nested loops, try to reduce the number of iterations by optimizing the algorithm or using better data structures.\n\n2. Use efficient algorithms and data structures: For large data sets, it is important to use efficient algorithms with the right data structures to reduce the processing time.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary operations: Remove any unnecessary operations or conditions in the code that can slow down the execution time.\n\n4. Use parallel processing: If possible, use parallel processing to split the work across multiple threads or cores to speed up the execution time.\n\n5. Test with smaller data sets: If the function works correctly with smaller data sets, but times out with larger sets, try to split the data into smaller chunks and process them sequentially to avoid the timeout.\n\nIf none of these tips help in resolving the issue, I suggest providing me with the actual code, and I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
