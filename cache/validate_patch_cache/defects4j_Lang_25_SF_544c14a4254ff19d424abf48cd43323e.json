However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like there might be an issue with an equals sign. \n\nHere's an example of how using an equals sign instead of a comparison operator (e.g., `==`) can cause a compilation error: \n\n```\nint x = 5;\nif (x = 10) {\n    System.out.println(\"x is equal to 10.\");\n}\n```\nIn this example, we're trying to assign `10` to `x` within the condition of the `if` statement, but we used an equals sign instead of a comparison operator. This causes a compilation error because the expression `x = 10` is an assignment, not a comparison. \n\nTo fix this, we can change the equals sign to a comparison operator (`==`): \n\n```\nint x = 5;\nif (x == 10) {\n    System.out.println(\"x is equal to 10.\");\n}\n```\n\nIf you could provide more context or the original code, I can provide more specific guidance.",
