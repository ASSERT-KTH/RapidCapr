    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous solutions. Without any additional information about the code or the test cases, it's difficult to provide a more complete solution. Here are a few general tips to try and resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Consider re-writing the code to be more efficient. If the code is taking too long to run, it's possible that there are inefficiencies in the algorithm or implementation that can be improved.\n\n2. Use tools to optimize the code. Profiling tools and other performance analysis tools can help identify areas of the code that are taking too long to execute.\n\n3. Check the inputs to the code. If the test runs are timing out, it's possible that the inputs being provided to the code are too large or complex. Consider reducing the size of the input data to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n4. Try running the tests on a more powerful machine. If the timeout issue is due to hardware limitations, running on a machine with more processing power or memory could help.\n\nPlease provide the actual code and error messages, if possible, so that I can give more detailed guidance on how to resolve the issue.",
