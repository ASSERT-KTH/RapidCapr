    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect response. Without seeing the original code and knowing the exact problem, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, the error message suggests that the test is taking too long to run and eventually times out after 10 minutes. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as inefficient algorithms, large input sizes, etc.\n\nOne suggested solution would be to optimize your code to improve its efficiency and reduce the amount of time it takes to run the test. Another solution could be to increase the timeout or modify the test to reduce the input size.\n\nAlternatively, you could provide me with the original code and more details about the problem for me to understand the issue better and provide a specific solution.",
