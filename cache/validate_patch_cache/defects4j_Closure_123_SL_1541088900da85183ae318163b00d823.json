It seems like there is still an issue with the code. \n\nBased on the compilation error message you provided, it seems that there may be some syntax error or missing code around the buggy line which is causing the error.\n\nWithout seeing the rest of the code, it's difficult to identify the exact issue causing the error. Could you please provide more context or additional code that surrounds the buggy line, so I can have a better understanding of the issue?\n\nAlternatively, you can try checking for any unclosed statements or syntax errors in the code that may be causing this issue.",
