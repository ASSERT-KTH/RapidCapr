    "patch": "I apologize for the issues you have been facing. Please try the following implementation:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = Arrays.stream(distribution).sum();\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return Arrays.copyOf(distribution, distribution.length);\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation is similar to the previous one, but rather than using the `map` method to apply the quotient to each element, it manually iterates through the array and calculates the normalized values, storing them in a new array. It also handles the case where all the values in the input array are 0 by returning a copy of the original array.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Please let me know if you have any further questions.",
