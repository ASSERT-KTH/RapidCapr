It's difficult to provide a solution without more information or access to the code being tested. \n\nHowever, since the test is timing out, it may be helpful to optimize the code for performance. Is there a section of the code that is particularly slow or resource-intensive? If so, it may be helpful to investigate ways to optimize that section of the code to improve performance.\n\nAlternatively, consider splitting the test into smaller, more focused tests that can be executed more quickly. This can help identify the specific part of the code that is causing the timeout and make it easier to troubleshoot and fix.",
