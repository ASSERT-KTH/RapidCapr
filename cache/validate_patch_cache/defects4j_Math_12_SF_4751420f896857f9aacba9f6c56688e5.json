However, based on the error message, it seems that the test is taking longer than the set time limit of 600 seconds and is timing out.\n\nYou can try increasing the time limit, optimizing your code to improve its performance, or possibly splitting the large test case into smaller ones.\n\nIf you can provide the code causing the error, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
