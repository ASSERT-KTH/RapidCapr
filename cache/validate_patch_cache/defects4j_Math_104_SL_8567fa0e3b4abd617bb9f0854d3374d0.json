Based on the error message you provided, it seems like there is a missing class, interface, or enum declaration in the code file. \n\nWithout seeing the full code file, it's difficult to determine where the infill location should be. To address the compilation error, please make sure that all necessary class, interface, or enum declarations have been included and that their syntax is correct.\n\nIf you can provide more context or the full code file, I can try to assist you further in finding and fixing the issue.",
