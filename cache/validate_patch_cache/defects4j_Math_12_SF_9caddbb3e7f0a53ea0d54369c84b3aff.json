    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working and for any inconvenience caused. Without any code or additional information, it is hard for me to provide an accurate solution.\n\nThe \"Test timed out after 600 seconds\" error typically occurs when the code or algorithm being tested takes too long to complete. To resolve this error, you need to optimize your code to improve its performance.\n\nHere are some general steps you can take to optimize your code:\n\n1. Identify the part of the code or algorithm that is causing the timeout error. You can do this by adding print statements or using a debugger to trace the execution path of your code.\n2. Once you have identified the problematic code, try to rewrite it using more efficient algorithms or data structures. Use asymptotic analysis (i.e., Big-O notation) to estimate the time complexity of your code, and try to reduce it as much as possible.\n3. Use caching or memoization techniques if appropriate to avoid recomputing values that have already been computed.\n4. Optimize loops and conditionals. Use short-circuit evaluation to exit loops early if possible.\n5. Use parallelization if you have a multi-core processor and your code is CPU-bound. Use asynchronous programming techniques if your code is I/O-bound.\n\nIf you provide me with the code or the test case, I can help you to identify and resolve the issue more accurately.",
