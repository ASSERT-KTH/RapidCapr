Here's another attempt that's efficient and should not time out:\n\n``` java\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic static double[] generateDistribution(int n, double mean, double sd) {\n    double[] distribution = new double[n];\n    Random random = new Random();\n    double sum = 0.0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        distribution[i] = random.nextGaussian() * sd + mean;\n        sum += distribution[i];\n    }\n\n    double average = sum / n;\n    double deviation = 0.0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        deviation += (distribution[i] - average) * (distribution[i] - average);\n    }\n\n    deviation = Math.sqrt(deviation / (n - 1));\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        distribution[i] = (distribution[i] - average) / deviation;\n    }\n\n    return distribution;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation creates an array for the distribution, generates the normal distribution values using `java.util.Random`, calculates the average and standard deviation of the generated values and finally normalizes them to a distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \n\nI hope that this version of the function works for you.",
