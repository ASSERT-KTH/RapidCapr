    "patch": "Based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is experiencing a timeout and not a compilation error. This could be caused by a long-running or inefficient algorithm in the function being tested.\n\nWithout access to the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to address timeout issues:\n\n1. Check if there are any nested loops or recursive calls that could be causing the function to take a long time to execute. Consider optimizing the algorithm or breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.\n\n2. If the function involves complex computations, consider using memoization or dynamic programming to save previously computed results and reduce computation time.\n\n3. Consider parallelizing the function using multi-threading or other concurrency techniques, if applicable.\n\n4. If the function involves I/O operations or external API requests, make sure to handle timeouts properly and use caching when possible.\n\n5. Check if there are any resource constraints, such as memory or CPU usage, that could be causing the function to take a long time. If so, consider optimizing the code or using more powerful hardware.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just general tips and may not be applicable to every case. Without access to the specific code and test case, it's difficult to provide a more tailored solution.",
