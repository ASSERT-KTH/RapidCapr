Based on the error that you mentioned, it seems like the issue is not with the `Context rhsContext` initialization. \n\nAs per the error message, it seems to be a syntactical error. To help you out further, I would need to see the entire codebase.\n\nCan you please provide me with access to the entire codebase and also specify the version of Java that is being used? I can then have a look and provide the necessary correction.",
