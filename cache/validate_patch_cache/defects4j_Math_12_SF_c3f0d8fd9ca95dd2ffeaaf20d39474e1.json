    "patch": "I apologize that the previous implementation did not solve the issue. Without additional information or code to review, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution. However, I can suggest a few potential fixes that may help resolve the issue.\n\n1. Increase timeout duration: It is possible that the test is timing out due to the size or complexity of the input data. You can try increasing the timeout duration for the test to see if it completes successfully.\n\n2. Optimize the code: It is possible that the implementation of the `generateDistribution` function is inefficient, or that there are other areas of the code that can be optimized. You can try profiling the code to identify areas that may be causing slowdowns, and then optimize those areas.\n\n3. Parallelize the code: If the code is processing a large amount of data, it may be possible to parallelize the code to improve performance. You can try parallelizing the `generateDistribution` function or other parts of the code to see if it improves performance.\n\n4. Simplify the code: If the code is overly complex or difficult to understand, it may be difficult to identify and fix the issue. You can try simplifying the code to make it easier to identify and fix issues.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused, and I hope these suggestions are helpful in resolving the issue.
