    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The timeout error indicates that the test is taking too long to run. In order to fix this, we will need to optimize the code and make it more efficient. \n\nWithout having the actual code, I won't be able to provide specific recommendations. However, here are some general tips to improve code performance:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures: Make sure you are using the most appropriate data structures for your task. For example, if you need to search for elements frequently, you should use a hash table instead of an array.\n\n2. Reduce unnecessary calculations: If you are performing complex calculations that are not needed, remove them. Simplify your code as much as possible.\n\n3. Limit unnecessary I/O operations: If you have frequent I/O operations, try to minimize them as much as possible. Use buffering to reduce the number of I/O operations.\n\n4. Parallelize computations: In some cases, it might be possible to parallelize computations to speed up the program. For example, you might be able to parallelize loops that are independent of each other.\n\nI suggest you identify what specific part of your code is causing the timeout and then optimize it according to the tips above.\n\nAlternatively, you can try increasing the timeout duration, but I strongly recommend against this as it only postpones the issue and does not address the root problem.",
