    "patch": "I apologize for the ongoing issues. Without seeing the original code and test case, it's difficult for me to determine the cause of the timeout error. However, I can provide a general strategy for debugging this type of error which may help you find a solution:\n\n1. Look at the lines of code that are being executed when the timeout occurs.\n2. Identify any loops that may be causing the timeout. Are there any that are running indefinitely or with a very large iteration count?\n3. Add logging statements to the code to help identify where the problem is occurring.\n4. Break the code down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Test each piece individually to see if any specific section of the code is the cause of the problem.\n5. Consider using a profiler to analyze the code and identify performance bottlenecks.\n\nOnce you have identified the cause of the timeout error, you can revise the code to be more efficient and/or fix any bugs that are causing the issue.",
