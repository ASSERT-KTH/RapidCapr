Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, if the test is timing out, it might be because of a long-running loop or an O(n^2) algorithm. You can try to optimize the code or increase the timeout limit if possible. \n\nIf you can provide me with more information or the code itself, I will be happy to assist you further.",
