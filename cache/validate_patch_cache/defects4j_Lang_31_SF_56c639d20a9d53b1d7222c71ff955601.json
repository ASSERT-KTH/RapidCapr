    "patch": "I apologize for the syntax error in the previous code. I have corrected the code and here is the updated implementation:\n\n``` java\npublic static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n    if (cs == null || searchChars == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int csLength = cs.length();\n    int searchLength = searchChars.length;\n    boolean[] matched = new boolean[Character.MAX_VALUE + 1];\n    for (int i = 0; i < searchLength; i++) {\n        char c = searchChars[i];\n        if (c < matched.length) {\n            matched[c] = true;\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < csLength; i++) {\n        char c = cs.charAt(i);\n        if (c < matched.length && matched[c]) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        if (Character.isHighSurrogate(c) && i < csLength - 1) {\n            int codePoint = Character.codePointAt(cs, i);\n            i++; // consume the low surrogate as well\n            if (codePoint < matched.length && matched[codePoint]) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThe updated implementation utilizes a boolean array `matched` to store the matches found in the `searchChars[]` array. The `matched` array is indexed by the character value, and a value of true indicates that the character has been found in the `searchChars[]` array. The function iterates over the characters of the input `cs` CharSequence, checking each character and, if necessary, the next character to form a codepoint. When a character is found in the `searchChars[]` array, the function immediately returns true.\n\nI hope this correction solves the issue. Let me know if you need any further help!",
