    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, based on the compilation error, it appears that the test is taking longer than the allowed timeout of 600 seconds to execute.\n\nIn this case, you could try optimizing the code to reduce its execution time or increasing the timeout value of the test. \n\nIf optimizing the code is not possible or feasible, increasing the timeout value of the test may be the best solution. However, keep in mind that increasing the timeout value may mask underlying issues in the code and is generally not a recommended solution.\n\nAlternatively, you could try splitting the test into smaller, more focused tests that test specific parts of the functionality. This can help isolate any issues and make it easier to identify and fix them.\n\nIf none of these options solve the problem, it may be necessary to analyze the code more closely to identify the root cause of the slow execution time and implement targeted fixes to improve its performance.",
