However, here are some general tips on addressing test timeouts:\n\n1. Check if the test is taking too long because of long-running computations or I/O operations. If so, consider optimizing the code or using mock objects to simulate the behavior.\n\n2. Increase the timeout value for the test. This can be done by adding the `@Test(timeout = N)` annotation to the test method, where `N` is the timeout in milliseconds.\n\n3. Split the test into smaller, more focused tests. This can help isolate the issue and make it easier to diagnose and fix.\n\n4. If the test is still timing out after trying the above steps, consider running the test on a more powerful machine or using parallel test execution.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful in resolving the test timeout issue.",
