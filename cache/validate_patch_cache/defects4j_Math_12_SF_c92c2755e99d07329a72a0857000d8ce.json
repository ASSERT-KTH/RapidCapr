Here are some possible solutions:\n- Optimize the code to reduce its runtime complexity.\n- Increase the timeout duration in the unit test framework.\n- Check if there are any I/O operations or network calls that are slowing down the program and optimize accordingly.\n- Check if there are any deadlock situations in the program and fix them.\n- Run the program with a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.\n\nPlease provide more information about the code and context for a more accurate solution.",
