    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to understand what the problem could be. However, here are some general tips to help you debug and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check if the tests are taking too long to run. If the tests are too slow, you could consider optimizing your code or reducing the size of the data being processed.\n\n2. Look for infinite loops or other algorithms that may be causing the test to time out. This can often happen if the algorithm is too complex or if the code is not properly optimized.\n\n3. Consider using a debugger to step through your code and identify the source of the problem.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information or the code that is causing the problem, I would be happy to help you identify the issue and provide a solution.",
