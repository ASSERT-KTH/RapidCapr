Without seeing your code, I cannot provide a specific solution.\n\nThe error message you are seeing indicates that your test is taking longer than the maximum allowable time of 600 seconds to run. This typically occurs when the code being tested is inefficient or has an infinite loop, such that it cannot complete in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nTo fix the issue, you will need to optimize your code or use a more efficient algorithm to complete the test within the time limit. \n\nIf you could provide me with more information about your code and the specific test that is timing out, I may be able to offer more specific guidance.",
