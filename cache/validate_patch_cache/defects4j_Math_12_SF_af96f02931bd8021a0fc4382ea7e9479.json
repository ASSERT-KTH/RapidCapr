    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The code you provided is taking an excessive amount of time to execute, and it is timing out the test case.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, the test case has been set to run for 600 seconds. This is an extremely long time for a test case to execute, and it is likely that there is some inefficient or incorrect code in your implementation that is causing the test to time out.\n\nWithout more information or the actual code, it is challenging to determine precisely what the issue is. However, I recommend the following steps to help you resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. Check your code to see if there are any infinite loops or nested loops that might be causing the delay. If you find any, try to optimize them by reducing the number of iterations or using more efficient algorithms.\n\n2. Analyze your code for any performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies. You can use a profiling tool to identify such bottlenecks and then optimize your code accordingly.\n\n3. Verify the input size of the test case. If the input is too large, it may cause the function to take an excessive amount of time to execute. You may need to modify your algorithm to handle larger input sizes more efficiently.\n\n4. If none of the above solutions work, you might consider splitting your code into smaller functions and testing them individually. This might help you isolate the specific function causing the issue and identify the problem easier.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you solve the issue. However, if you can provide me with more information about your code, I would be happy to help you further.",
