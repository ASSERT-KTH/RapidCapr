Without seeing the entire code or understanding the exact nature of the problem, it's difficult to give you a precise solution to the issue you are facing. However, here are a few suggestions that may be helpful:\n\n- Check for infinite loops and ensure that the code is optimized to the best of your abilities.\n- If the code is taking too long to run and cannot be optimized further, consider alternative approaches such as parallel processing or using a more efficient data structure.\n- Consider increasing the timeout limit of the test if possible, or breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable pieces to make it easier to debug and test.\n\nIf you could provide more information or the entire codebase, I may be able to provide more specific guidance.",
