    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. A test timing out after 600 seconds means that the program is taking far too long to execute. Without knowing the specific context and code, I can suggest some general strategies to improve the program's performance:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for inefficiencies and redundant computations. Simplify the code where possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce the size of input data: If feasible, test the code on smaller test cases to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nIn addition, consider reviewing and optimizing the test cases as well, since they may be consuming a large portion of the execution time.\n\nWithout more specific information, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. I apologize for any inconvenience and I hope this helps in resolving the issue.",
