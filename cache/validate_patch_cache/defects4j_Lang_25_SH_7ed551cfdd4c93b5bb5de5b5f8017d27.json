    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. Without the actual code and more information about the bug, I'm unable to provide a specific hunk. However, based on the compilation error you mentioned, it seems like there is an issue with an equals sign \"=\" in the code. \n\nPlease check if there is an equals sign that is not being used correctly. It could be an assignment statement where a comparison was intended, or perhaps a typo. You might want to double-check the syntax of the code around the point of the error.\n\nOnce the issue is resolved and the code compiles without error, please re-run the test case and see if the original bug has been fixed.",
