    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code and knowing more about the problem, it is difficult to provide the correct function. However, here are some possible reasons for the function to time out:\n\n1. The function is taking too long to compute. You may want to optimize the algorithm or consider using parallelism where appropriate.\n2. There might be an infinite loop or recursion depth issue in the code. Check if the program is stuck in a loop or recursively calling the function indefinitely.\n3. The input size is too large, causing the function to take a long time to process. Consider using a faster data structure or algorithm that can handle large inputs efficiently.\n\nI suggest you review the code and perform some debugging to determine the source of the issue. If you are still stuck, please provide more details about the problem and the code so I can assist you further.",
