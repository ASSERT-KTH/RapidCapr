    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some changes that might help to fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: If the program is taking too long to execute, it may be necessary to optimize the algorithm to reduce the computational complexity.\n\n2. Remove any loops that are unnecessary: Sometimes, loops can cause an increase in computational time. Hence, it's important to check if any loops can be removed.\n\n3. Make use of parallel processing: If the program is processing a large amount of data, parallel processing could be used to split the data into chunks and process them simultaneously.\n\n4. Increase the timeout duration: If the program is performing complex computations that cannot be simplified or optimized, the timeout duration for the test can be increased to allow more time for the program to execute.\n\n5. Find the root cause of the timeout error: If the program is still timing out after the above steps, it may be necessary to analyze the code more closely to identify the root cause of the timeout error.\n\nWithout being able to see the full code and context, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
