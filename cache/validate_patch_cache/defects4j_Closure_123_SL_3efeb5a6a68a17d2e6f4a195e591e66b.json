Without additional information about the code or the specific line number where the error occurs, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the error.\n\nHowever, I can provide some possible reasons for the error message:\n\n1. The code may be missing a closing brace or parenthesis.\n2. The code may have a syntax error, such as an incorrect keyword or operator.\n3. The code may have a scope issue, where a variable is defined outside of its scope.\n\nPlease provide me with more information, such as the full code snippet or the specific file name and line number where the error occurred, so I can provide a more accurate solution.",
