    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. It seems that the issue is due to a syntax error in the code.\n\nWithout access to the full code and location of the infill, I am unable to suggest a specific solution. However, here are some common causes of the error message \"class, interface, or enum expected\" that may help in troubleshooting:\n\n1. The infill code may be missing a closing brace `}` somewhere in the code, causing the compiler to expect a class, interface, or enum declaration.\n\n2. The infill code may contain a statement outside of a method or initialization block, which is not allowed in Java.\n\n3. The infill code may be missing a semicolon at the end of a statement or declaration.\n\nPlease review the infill code carefully and ensure that it follows the syntax rules of Java. If you still encounter any issues, please provide me with more information on the location of the infill and the full error message so I can assist you better.",
