    "patch": "Based on the compilation error you provided, it appears that the test is timing out. This could be due to the function taking too long to execute or getting stuck in an infinite loop. Without access to the original code, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, some possible fixes could be to optimize the function's logic or simplify the code to reduce the amount of processing required. Additionally, you may want to consider splitting the function into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.",
