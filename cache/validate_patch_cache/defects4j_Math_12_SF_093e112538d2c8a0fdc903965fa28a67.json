    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and understanding the context of the issue, it is difficult for me to provide a fix. \n\nHowever, a timeout error can occur if the function takes too long to run or if there is an infinite loop in the code. One possible solution is to check the loop conditions and/or reduce the time complexity of the function.\n\nIf you could please provide the code and more details about the issue, I would be happy to take a look and provide a more specific solution.",
