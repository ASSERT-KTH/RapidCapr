    "patch": "I apologize for the earlier solution not working as expected. Here's another implementation that should work and will not result in a timeout. This is a greedy solution that works in O(n^2) time complexity.\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] currentDistribution = distribution.clone();\n    double[] nextDistribution = new double[n];\n    while (m-- > 0) {\n        Arrays.fill(nextDistribution, 0);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                nextDistribution[(i + j) % n] += currentDistribution[i] * distribution[j] / n;\n            }\n        }\n        currentDistribution = nextDistribution.clone();\n    }\n    return currentDistribution;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two `double` arrays, `currentDistribution` and `nextDistribution`, to store the probability distributions at the current and next rounds, respectively. We use `Arrays.fill` method to initialize `nextDistribution` array with zeros at the start of each round. Then, for each box index `i`, we iterate over all the boxes `j` and distribute the balls in box `i` evenly among all the boxes, resulting in an updated probability distribution `nextDistribution`.\n\nWe repeat this process `m` times, updating the current and next probability distributions at each step. Finally, we return the final probability distribution stored in `currentDistribution`.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
