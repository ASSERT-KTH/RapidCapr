    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without access to the code and specific context, it is difficult to suggest an appropriate solution. However, a test timing out after 600 seconds suggests that the code is either taking too long to execute or is caught in an infinite loop. \n\nHere are some potential strategies to address this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for inefficiencies and redundant computations. Simplify the code where possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce input data size: If feasible, test the code on smaller test cases to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nI hope this helps in resolving the issue. Nonetheless, if you provide me with the code and detailed context, I would be more than happy to assist you further in fixing the issue.",
