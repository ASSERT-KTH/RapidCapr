    "patch": "Without seeing the code, it is not possible to provide the correct function. The timeout error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute. The issue could be with the algorithm or with the size of the input. Here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. Improve the algorithm complexity: Analyze the algorithm used by the original code and see if it can be improved to run faster. Use data structures like hash tables to improve the search time.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the algorithm cannot be improved further, try to reduce the input size. For instance, if the code is processing an image, try processing a smaller portion of the image.\n\n3. Use concurrency: If the algorithm is computationally heavy, try using concurrency or parallelism to speed up the execution. \n\n4. Use caching: Use caching to store the results of expensive computations so that they can be reused later, avoiding re-computation of the same results.",
