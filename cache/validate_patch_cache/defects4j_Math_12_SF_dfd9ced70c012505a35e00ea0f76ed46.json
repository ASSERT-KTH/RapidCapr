    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working and causing further issues. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue with the code without seeing it. \n\nThat said, it is clear that the code is taking too long to run and is causing the test to time out. This is likely due to an inefficient algorithm or an infinite loop somewhere in the code. \n\nTo resolve this, I would recommend reviewing the code and analyzing the algorithm to see if there are any improvements that can be made. You can also try running the code with smaller inputs to see if it completes in a reasonable amount of time before attempting to run it on larger inputs. \n\nIf you are still struggling to resolve the issue, it may be helpful to seek assistance from a colleague or a mentor with more experience in the programming language being used.",
