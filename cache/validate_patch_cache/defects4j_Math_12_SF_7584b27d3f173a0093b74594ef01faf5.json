    "patch": "I'm sorry that my previous solution still didn't work, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. Without any code or additional information, it is hard for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, I'll suggest the following general steps to resolve the timeout error in your test case:\n\n1. Check if your code has any infinite loops or frequently occurring nested loops that might be causing the test to time out.\n2. Try checking if you are using inefficient algorithms in your code. Sometimes, inefficient algorithms can cause the test cases to run for a longer time and eventually time out.\n3. Implement a logging mechanism using print statements to identify which part of your code is taking longer than expected. You can then optimize that part of the code to improve performance.\n4. Run your code on sample inputs with the debugger to trace its execution path and identify any performance bottlenecks.\n5. If all of the above steps fail to rectify the issue, try increasing the timeout time for your test case. You can do this by changing the timeout parameter of your test case.\n\nI hope this helps in resolving your issue. However, If you can provide the code causing the error, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
