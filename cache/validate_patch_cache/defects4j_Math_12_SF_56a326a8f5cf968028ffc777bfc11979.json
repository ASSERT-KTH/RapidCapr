    "patch": "I apologize for the recurring issues. Without seeing the actual code and its requirements, I cannot provide a more specific solution for this issue. \n\nHowever, here are a few tips that can help reduce the likelihood of test timeouts:\n\n1. Focus on specific test cases: Consider creating focused test cases to ensure that each test is quick and concise. The smaller the scope of the test, the less it has to do and respond, leading to quicker tests.\n\n2. Mock external dependencies: When tests rely on external services which may not respond quickly, mocking these external dependencies can keep the tests more contained and optimized.\n\n3. Parallelize test execution: Some testing frameworks such as TestNG, in addition to Maven+Surefire, enable executing tests in parallel, and this feature can utilize multiple CPUs to speed things up.\n\n4. Increase test timeout limits: While this isn't an optimal solution, sometimes increasing the timeout limit for tests can work around an issue, perhaps it's making the test case too complex, which need to be solved.\n\nIf you can provide the actual code and build logs of your problem, I may be able to provide a tailored solution to this issue.",
