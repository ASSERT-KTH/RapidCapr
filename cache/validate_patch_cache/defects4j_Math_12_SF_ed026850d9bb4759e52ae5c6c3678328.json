    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working as expected. Without knowing the code, I am unable to provide a specific solution that will resolve this issue. However, here are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. Check the implementation for any infinite loops or infinite recursion that may cause the program to hang indefinitely.\n2. Make sure that the test environment has sufficient resources to execute the test in a reasonable amount of time. For example, if the test requires a lot of memory, make sure that the machine hosting the test environment has enough available memory.\n3. Consider refactoring the code to reduce its complexity. If the program is too complex, it is more likely to fail or timeout.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details about the code and the specific error/exception messages, I can provide a more targeted solution.",
