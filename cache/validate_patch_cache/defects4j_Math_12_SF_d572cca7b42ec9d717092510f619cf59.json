Without seeing the code causing the timeout error, I cannot provide a specific solution.\n\nIt may be helpful to check the code for any infinite loops or excessive resource usage. Additionally, optimizing the code or reducing the size of the data being processed may improve the performance and prevent timeout errors.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code causing the timeout error, I can offer a more specific solution.",
