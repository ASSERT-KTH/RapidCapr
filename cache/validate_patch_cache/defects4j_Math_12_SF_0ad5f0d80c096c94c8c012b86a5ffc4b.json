However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the function is taking too long to execute and is timing out. Here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. Try to optimize the function to reduce its execution time. Look for any unnecessary computation or loops that can be eliminated.\n2. Consider using multithreading or parallelization to split the computation across multiple cores or machines.\n3. Increase the timeout limit to give the function more time to execute.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and context so I can better assist you.",
