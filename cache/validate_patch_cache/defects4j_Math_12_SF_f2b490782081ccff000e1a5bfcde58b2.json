    "patch": "If the code is timing out after 600 seconds even after modifying it, it's possible that the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment it's running on, such as a slow computer or limited resources.\n\nOne possible solution is to run the code on a more powerful machine with more resources, such as a server or cloud-based virtual machine.\n\nAnother option is to optimize the code even further to reduce the running time. This could include using more efficient algorithms or data structures, parallelizing computations, or minimizing I/O operations.\n\nFinally, you could try splitting the code into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks and running them independently. This can help isolate the problem and make it easier to debug and fix.\n\nWithout access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I hope these suggestions have been helpful.",
