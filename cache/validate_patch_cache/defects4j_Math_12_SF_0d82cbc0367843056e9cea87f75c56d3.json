    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Without the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. Nonetheless, here is a generic solution you could try:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] arr) {\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double val : arr) {\n        sum += val;\n    }\n    double[] result = new double[arr.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        result[i] = arr[i] / sum;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis normalizes an array by dividing each element by the sum of all elements in the array. Please make sure to test it thoroughly before using it in your code.",
