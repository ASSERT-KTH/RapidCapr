    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a solution that won't time out. Here are a few potential solutions to the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Take a closer look at the algorithm being used. There may be ways to optimize it so it runs more quickly.\n\n2. Increase the timeout: Depending on the testing framework being used, there may be a configuration option to increase the timeout threshold. This will allow the code to run for a longer period of time before timing out.\n\n3. Break up the test: If the test is testing multiple functionalities at once, consider breaking it up into smaller, more specific tests. This can help make the code easier to debug and prevent timeouts.\n\nI hope these suggestions help.",
