    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts and the delay. Without the code or more information, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, please try the following steps to debug the issue:\n\n1. Check the test case itself: Verify that the input values are within the correct range and format. Ensure that the test case is not improperly constructed and is actually testing the proper functionality.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops or recursion: Verify that there are no infinite loops or recursion that could be causing the infinite execution time.\n\n3. Check the system load and available resources: Verify that the environment in which the test is being executed has sufficient resources to execute the test without timing out.\n\n4. Review the code and identify potential bottlenecks: Consider using profiling tools to identify where the code is spending the most time. Once identified, consider optimizing that part of the code to reduce the overall execution time.\n\nIf none of the above steps help, then please provide more information about the code, the test case, and the environment in which it is being executed, so we can determine a solution for the issue.",
