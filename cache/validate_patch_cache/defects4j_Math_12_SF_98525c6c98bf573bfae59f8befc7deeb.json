You might want to investigate if the function is experiencing infinite loops or the input data is too large. \n\nHere are some possible solutions you can try to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the function to reduce its execution time.\n2. Use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to solve the problem.\n3. Divide the input data into smaller chunks to reduce the complexity.\n4. Use parallel processing or asynchronous programming to speed up the execution.\n5. Consider using a cloud-based service to run the function.\n\nI hope this helps!",
