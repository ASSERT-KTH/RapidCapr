    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It's difficult to provide a specific solution without seeing the code. Here is a general approach to fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursion in the code.\n2. Optimize any complex algorithms, and consider using data structures to improve performance.\n3. Use a debugger or logging statements to identify the root cause of the time out. \n4. Refactor the code to decrease overall execution time, which can include reducing the number of iterations or optimizing code blocks. \n5. Make use of multi-threading if possible to perform tasks concurrently and improve performance. \n\nIf you can provide more specific information about the code and the issue you are experiencing, I may be able to provide a more targeted solution.",
