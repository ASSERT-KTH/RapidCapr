    "patch": "I apologize for the error. Without seeing the code, it's difficult for me to determine the root cause of the problem. However, I can provide you with general strategies to help fix this issue.\n\nOne possibility is that the function is taking too long to complete. This could be due to an inefficiency in the algorithm used or a large input size. To fix this, you could try to optimize the algorithm or reduce the input size.\n\nAnother possibility is that the function is stuck in an infinite loop or recursion. To fix this, you could check your loop and recursion conditions to ensure they are correctly terminating.\n\nLastly, the test may be set up incorrectly and causing the timeout. You could try to isolate the problem by running the test independently and verifying that it works correctly. If the test passes, then you could try running other tests to see if the problem persists.\n\nIf you are still unable to resolve the issue, please provide me with more information, such as the code snippet, so that I can better assist you.",
