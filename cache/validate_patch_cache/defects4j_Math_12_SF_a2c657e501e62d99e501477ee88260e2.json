    "patch": "I'm sorry, but the first code snippet you provided is already the correct function that fixes the bug in the original code. It adds a check to handle the case when the input `x` is outside the expected range of `[0, RADIX)`, and calls a different `multiply` function if needed.\n\nAs for the second code snippet, I would need to see the original code to understand the context and what might be causing the failure in the `testDistributionClone` test. Without seeing more of the code, it's impossible to provide a correct fix for the bug.",
