Without seeing the code or understanding the context of the error, it is difficult for me to provide a definitive solution. \n\nHowever, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the code is not efficient enough and needs to be optimized. Some potential ways to optimize the code may include revising any nested loops, reducing the amount of memory usage, or using more efficient algorithms. \n\nIf you can provide me with the code and some context about the problem you are trying to solve, I can provide more tailored advice for optimizing the code.",
