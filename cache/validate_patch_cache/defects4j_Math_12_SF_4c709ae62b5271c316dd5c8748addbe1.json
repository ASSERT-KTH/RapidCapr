Without seeing the actual code and understanding the cause of the timeout error, it is difficult for me to provide a solution. \n\nIn general, a timeout error occurs when the code takes too long to execute. This can be caused by a number of factors, including inefficient algorithms or data structures, large input sizes, or issues with resource utilization.\n\nTo provide a possible solution, I would need to analyze the code and identify the cause of the timeout error. If you could provide me with the actual code and any additional information, I would be happy to try and help further.",
