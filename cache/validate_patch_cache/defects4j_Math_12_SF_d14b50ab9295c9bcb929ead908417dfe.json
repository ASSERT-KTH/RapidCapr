It would be helpful if you could provide more context or information about the code and the bug.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, since the test is timing out, it is likely that the code is stuck in an infinite loop or is taking too long to execute.\n\nOne possible solution would be to look for any loops or recursive functions that may be taking too long to execute and optimize them. Another solution would be to increase the timeout limit for the test, if possible.\n\nIf you can provide more information or the relevant code snippet, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide further assistance.",
