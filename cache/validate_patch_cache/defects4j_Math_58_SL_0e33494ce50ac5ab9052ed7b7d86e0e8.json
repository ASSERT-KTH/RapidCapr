    "patch": "I apologize for the error in the previous suggestion. The correct line at the infill location for the first buggy code is:\n\n```\nreturn multiply(100).doubleValue();\n```\n\nFor the second buggy code, the correct line at the infill location will depend on the specific details of the code. However, based on the error message provided, it seems like the value `-1.277` is causing a `NotStrictlyPositiveException` which suggests that only positive values are allowed in the calculation. Therefore, one possible fix for the infill location could be to add a check to ensure the value is positive before it is used in the calculation. For example:\n\n```\nif (value > 0.0) {\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n} else {\n    // handle the case where value is not positive\n}\n``` \n\nPlease let me know if this helps.",
