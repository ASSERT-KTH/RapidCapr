    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts not working as expected. Without seeing the actual code, it is difficult for me to provide you with a specific solution to the issue you are facing. \n\nHowever, a timeout error often occurs when a function takes longer than expected to execute. Here are a few ways to address that:\n\n1. Identify the specific block of code that is causing the timeout error using logging statements or debugging tools. Once you know which code block is causing the problem, you can try to optimize it or refactor it.\n2. Reduce the size of the input data, if possible, to decrease the time required to execute the function.\n3. Use multi-threading or parallel processing to speed up the execution of the code.\n4. If the code is highly complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, modular functions, as this can make it easier to identify and resolve performance issues.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information about the code and the specific test case that is timing out, I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
