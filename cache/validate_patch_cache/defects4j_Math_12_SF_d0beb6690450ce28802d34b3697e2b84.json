    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. The timeout error indicates that the code is taking too long to execute, which can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. Make sure all input data is correctly formatted and within expected bounds.\n\n2. Check for any infinite loops or recursive calls that may be causing the code to hang.\n\n3. Consider optimizing the code to reduce computation. This may include using efficient algorithms, caching or memoization, or parallel processing.\n\nWithout seeing the code or knowing more about the problem you are solving, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, I recommend reviewing the code for any potential issues and trying to optimize the computation as much as possible. It may also be helpful to break the computation into smaller tasks that can be completed separately and combine the results at the end to reduce overall execution time.",
