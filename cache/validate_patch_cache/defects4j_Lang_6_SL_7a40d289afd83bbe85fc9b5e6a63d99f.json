Here's the correct line of code at the infill location that should fix the test failure:\n```\npos += consumed > 0 ? consumed : Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\nif (pos+1 < len && input.charAt(pos)=='\\\\' && input.charAt(pos+1)=='b') {\n    out.write('\\b');\n    pos+=2;\n}\n```\nThis code first increments `pos` by either the number of code units in the current code point (if `consumed` is greater than 0) or the number of code units in the next code point (if `consumed` is 0). Then, it checks if there are at least two characters remaining in the input string, and the current character is a backslash and the next character is a `b`. If those conditions are met, it writes a backspace character to the output and increments `pos` by 2 to skip over the `\\\\b` escape sequence. This should correctly handle the `testBackspaceEscape` test case and fix the test failure you experienced.",
