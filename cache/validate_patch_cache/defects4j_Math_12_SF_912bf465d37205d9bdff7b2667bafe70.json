Without seeing the code, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the algorithm is not sufficiently optimized and is taking too long to execute on the input provided by the test. You can try refactoring the code to improve its efficiency, or dividing the input into smaller chunks that can be processed more quickly. \n\nIf you can provide the code causing the error, or more information about the problem you are facing, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
