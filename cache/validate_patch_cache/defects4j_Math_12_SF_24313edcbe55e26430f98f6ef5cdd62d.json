    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and understanding the requirements, it is very difficult to provide a correct function that meets all the specifications.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general approaches for fixing a code that times out:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Look for ways to optimize the code, both in terms of time and space complexity. Examples could include using more efficient data structures, early termination, or parallel processing.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the code works fine for smaller inputs but times out for larger inputs, consider reducing the input size.\n\n3. Increase the time limit: If the code is almost correct, and it just needs more time to run, try increasing the time limit in the testing environment.\n\n4. Use profiling and debugging tools: Use profiling tools to identify the slow parts of the code and use debugging tools to find and fix errors that can cause the code to slow down.\n\n5. Rewrite the code: If none of the above approaches work, consider rewriting the code from scratch using a different approach or algorithm.\n\nI hope these suggestions will help you fix your code.",
