    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. It is difficult to provide a solution without seeing the code and understanding the issue. \n\nTo address the timeout error, it is likely that the code has a performance issue. The function may be taking too long to complete, causing the test to time out. You may need to optimize the code to make it more efficient.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult to provide specific guidance on how to optimize it. However, some general tips for improving performance include:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures and algorithms.\n2. Minimize the number of iterations and function calls.\n3. Avoid unnecessary object creation and garbage collection.\n4. Use caching to avoid recalculating values.\n5. Use lazy initialization to defer calculations until they are needed.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the code and the specific issue you are facing, I may be able to provide more targeted guidance.",
