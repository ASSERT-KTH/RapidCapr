    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, without seeing the code, I cannot provide a specific fix to address the timeout issue. However, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Try to make the code more efficient, for example by reducing the number of nested loops or minimizing the amount of I/O operations.\n\n2. Use parallelization: Consider using multi-threading or parallel computing to run parts of the code simultaneously to speed up processing.\n\n3. Use caching: If the code involves repeated calculations or data access, consider caching frequently accessed data in memory.\n\n4. Increase resources: If possible, increase the amount of memory or processing power available to the code.\n\nI hope these tips help.",
