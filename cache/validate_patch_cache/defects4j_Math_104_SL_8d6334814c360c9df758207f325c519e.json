The correct line wasn't provided. \n\nAs the code is throwing a compilation error, it seems there is a missing class, interface or enum declaration in your code. The missing declaration might be the reason for the compilation error and the code failing the test.\n\nWithout the complete code, it's hard to determine the exact issue. Please check if all your class, interface, and enum declarations are present and are valid. Double-check if there are any missing or extra curly braces (`{}`) in the code.\n\nOnce all the declarations are in place, try running the test again and see if it passes.",
