    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. It seems that the timeout error still occurs even after increasing the timeout value. This could mean that there are other factors slowing down the test or causing it to hang indefinitely. \n\nOne approach to resolving this issue is to optimize the function being tested to improve its performance. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to suggest specific optimizations, but here are some general tips:\n\n- Check for unnecessary calculations or loop iterations that can be optimized or avoided.\n- Use more efficient data structures or algorithms that can perform computations faster.\n- Avoid performing the same calculations repeatedly by storing intermediate results and reusing them when possible.\n- If the function accesses external resources, ensure that these resources are accessible and respond quickly.\n\nIf optimizing the function is not an option, you can try running the test on a different machine or platform that can handle the computation better. Alternatively, you can break down the test into smaller, more manageable tests that can run faster and isolate any issues that may be causing the timeout error.",
