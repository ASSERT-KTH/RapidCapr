    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. It's difficult to determine the exact issue without seeing the code, but I can provide some general tips to help with the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that all loops have a termination condition. If there is a loop that runs indefinitely, it can lead to a timeout error.\n\n2. Optimize algorithms: If the algorithm has a worst-case time complexity, it can lead to a timeout error with large input values. Try to optimize the algorithms to reduce their time complexity.\n\n3. Use parallel processing: If possible, try to break the problem into smaller sub-tasks and process them in parallel. This can improve the overall performance of the code and reduce the chance of a timeout error.\n\n4. Use appropriate data structures: Use appropriate data structures like HashSet, HashMap, and others to improve the performance of the code.\n\n5. Increase the timeout value: If the above solutions are not working, try increasing the timeout value. However, this is not a recommended approach as it can lead to longer waiting times for the test results.\n\nI hope these tips help you identify and fix the timeout issue. However, if you can provide me with the problematic code and more information about the issue, I can attempt to provide more specific advice.",
