    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. Here is the corrected implementation for the `distributionClone` function:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n    if (a == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double value : a) {\n        sum += value;\n    }\n\n    double[] result = new double[a.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        result[i] = a[i] / sum;\n    }\n\n    double newSum = 0;\n    for (double value : result) {\n        newSum += value;\n    }\n\n    double roundingError = 1 - newSum;\n    result[result.length-1] += roundingError;\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation first calculates the sum of the input array. It then creates a new array with the same length as the input array and calculates the distribution clone by dividing each value in the input array by the sum. The code then recalculates the sum of the resulting array and determines whether there is any rounding error.\n\nIf there is rounding error, it adds it to the last element of the resulting array to ensure that the sum of all elements is 1. Finally, it returns the resulting array.\n\nPlease try this implementation and let me know if it resolves the issue.",
