    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the specific code and more information on the use case, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, I can suggest some general techniques to improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. Try to minimize the number of iterations in any loops or recursive functions. One way to do this is to use memoization to cache previously computed results.\n\n2. Use data structures that are optimized for the specific use case. For example, if you need to perform frequent lookups or deletions, a hash table or tree structure may be more efficient than an array or list.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary calculations. If possible, only compute the values that are immediately needed and avoid performing calculations that may not be necessary.\n\n4. Use parallelism or concurrency if possible. If the algorithm can be divided into independent tasks, running them in parallel may provide a significant speedup.\n\nAgain, without more information about the specific code and use case, it is difficult to provide a precise solution.",
