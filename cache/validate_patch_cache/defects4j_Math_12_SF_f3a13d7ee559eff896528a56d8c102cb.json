Without seeing the original code, I cannot provide a correct function.\n\nRegarding the timeout issue, it could be caused by a number of factors, including inefficient algorithms or an infinite loop. Please try optimizing the code by identifying any areas where the performance could be improved.\n\nIf that is not possible or if the issue persists, you may need to consider simplifying the test cases or adjusting the timeout duration.",
