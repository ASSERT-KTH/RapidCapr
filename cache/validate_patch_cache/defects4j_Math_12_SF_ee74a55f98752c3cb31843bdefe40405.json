    "patch": "Without seeing the entire codebase and the specific test that is timing out, it is difficult to provide a specific fix. However, here are some general tips to address a test timing out:\n\n1. Refactor the code: Break the code down into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be tested independently. This will help you identify which specific parts of the code are causing the test to time out.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Review the code and look for any inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks that could be causing the test to time out. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to improve the performance.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit: If the test is taking longer than expected due to a particularly complex or time-consuming operation, you may need to increase the timeout limit for that specific test.\n\n4. Use parallelization: Consider parallelizing the test suite to run it in parallel. This can help reduce the overall time for the test suite to complete.\n\n5. Improve hardware resources: Consider upgrading the hardware resources to improve the processing power and memory of the system running the test. This can help the test suite complete faster and reduce timeouts.",
