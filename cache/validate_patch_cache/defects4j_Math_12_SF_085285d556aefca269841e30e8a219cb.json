    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Without seeing the code it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, the \"Test timed out after 600 seconds\" error message suggests that the test is taking too long to complete.\n\nHere are some general tips to address this issue:\n- Make sure the test is not doing unnecessary computations or calculations.\n- Consider if there is a more efficient algorithm that can be used to accomplish the same task.\n- Check if there are any infinite loops or recursion happening in the code.\n- Review the test itself to ensure it is not unnecessarily lengthy or complex.\n- Check if the test environment is properly configured and resources such as memory and CPU are sufficient for the test to run efficiently.\n\nIf you can provide me with the original code and the test cases, I may be able to provide more specific advice on how to optimize the code or test to prevent it from timing out.",
