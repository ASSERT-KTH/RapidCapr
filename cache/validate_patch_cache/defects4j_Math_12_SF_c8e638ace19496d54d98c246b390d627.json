    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the full code and context of the problem, I'm unable to provide a precise solution. Here are some suggestions to help resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: It's important to ensure that there are no infinite loops in the function. These can quickly cause the function to run indefinitely and hit the timeout limit.\n\n2. Use efficient algorithms: Ensure that you're using the most efficient algorithms possible to solve the problem. This can help reduce the overall runtime of the function.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary computations: Make sure you're not performing unnecessary computations or loops that could be avoided. This can help reduce the overall runtime of the function.\n\n4. Parallelize the code: If possible, consider parallelizing the code to take advantage of multiple processing cores. This can help reduce the overall runtime of the function.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve the timeout issue, please provide more information about the problem and the code so that I can better understand the issue and provide a more tailored solution.",
