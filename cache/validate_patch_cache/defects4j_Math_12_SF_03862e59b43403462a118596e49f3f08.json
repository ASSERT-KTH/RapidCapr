    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the fix did not resolve the issue and caused a timeout error. Without seeing the code, I can only suggest that you try the following steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or excessive computational complexity in the code that may be causing the timeout error.\n2. Increase the timeout duration to a higher value as necessary, depending on the complexity of the code being executed and the resources available to the system.\n3. Consider optimizing the code to improve its efficiency and reduce its computational complexity, if possible.\n\nIf you provide me with more information about the code, I may be able to provide more specific suggestions or solutions to help resolve the timeout error.",
