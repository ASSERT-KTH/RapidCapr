    "patch": "I apologize for the continued difficulties. The long timeout suggests that the function is taking too long, which could be due to various reasons. One possibility is that the `generateDistribution` function is generating a distribution that is heavily skewed or otherwise difficult to sample from, causing the `fitDistribution` function to run for a long time. Another possibility is that the test case itself is too complex or involves too many samples.\n\nWithout more information about the specifics of the problem, it is difficult to provide an exact fix for the function. However, here are some general suggestions that may help.\n\nFirst, consider using a different distribution for the generated samples. The normal distribution used in the original implementation is a common choice, but it may not always be the best fit for the problem at hand. Depending on the requirements of the problem, other distributions such as the uniform distribution, exponential distribution, or Poisson distribution may be more appropriate. You could experiment with different distributions to see which performs better for your problem.\n\nSecond, consider reducing the number of samples generated by the `generateDistribution` function, or reducing the number of iterations performed by the `fitDistribution` function. These changes will obviously affect the accuracy of the final result, but may help to reduce the running time of the function.\n\nThird, consider optimizing the implementation of the `fitDistribution` function itself. There may be algorithms or techniques that can be used to make the function run faster or converge more quickly.\n\nAgain, without more information about the specific problem you are trying to solve, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. But I hope that these suggestions are helpful in resolving the issues you have been experiencing.",
