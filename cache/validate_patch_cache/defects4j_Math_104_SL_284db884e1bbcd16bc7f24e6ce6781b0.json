Check if the package declaration and imports are correct.\n2. Make sure that the class, interface, or enum syntax is correct and complete.\n3. Verify that all necessary methods and variables are defined and used correctly within the class.\n\nWithout more specific information about the source code, it is difficult to provide a more precise solution. If you could provide the code surrounding the infill location, it would be easier to identify the correct line of code to add.",
