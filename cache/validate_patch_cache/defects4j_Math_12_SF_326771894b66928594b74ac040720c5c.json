    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake. Without seeing the code, I can only provide general advice on how to fix a timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for performance bottlenecks in the code and try to optimize them. This could include reducing the number of loops or improving the data structures used in the code.\n\n2. Increase the timeout limit: Sometimes, a timeout error occurs simply because the code is taking longer to execute than the allowed time. Increasing the timeout limit can help fix this issue.\n\n3. Split up the code: If the code is too complex or too long to execute within the specified time limit, you can try splitting it up into smaller functions or methods and running them separately.\n\n4. Use parallel processing or threading: If appropriate, you can try using parallel processing or threading to speed up the execution of your code.\n\n5. Use a profiler: Profiling tools can help identify performance bottlenecks in your code and suggest ways to optimize it.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions.",
