Given the compilation timeout error, it's possible that the function is still inefficient and causing performance issues. Without the original code and more information, it's challenging to determine the root cause.\n\nHowever, I can provide general strategies for optimizing code further:\n\n1. Evaluate if there are unnecessary computations that can be eliminated.\n2. Determine if the algorithm can be further simplified or parallelized.\n3. Try to leverage parallel processing or multithreading to improve performance.\n4. Consider optimizing memory usage, such as using memory-efficient data structures.\n\nIf you can provide additional information or code snippets, I can better assist you in finding a solution.",
