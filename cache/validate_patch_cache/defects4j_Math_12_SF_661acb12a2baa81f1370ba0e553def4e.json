    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like the timeout error is still occurring. Without further information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general fixes that may help improve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops - If there are any loops in the function, make sure the condition to terminate the loop is efficient and cannot result in infinite looping.\n\n2. Optimize loops - If the function has any loops, make sure they are designed in an efficient manner, that is, reducing the overall number of iterations as much as possible.\n\n3. Use efficient data structures - If the function uses data structures such as arrays or lists, make sure to choose the appropriate data structure that provides the best performance for the particular use case.\n\n4. Profile the function - Use a profiling tool to identify the bottleneck in the function. This can help to optimize the performance of the function by targeting the specific area causing the issue.\n\nWithout the complete function and test case, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
