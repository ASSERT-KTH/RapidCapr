However, here are some general suggestions:\n\n1. Look for parts of the code that may be causing the function to take too long. Are there any loops or recursive calls that are unnecessarily repeated?\n2. Try to optimize the code by using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n3. Consider splitting the function into smaller, more manageable functions that can be executed independently and at a faster speed.\n4. Check if there are any external resources that the function is relying on (e.g. databases or web services) and optimize the communication with these resources.\n5. If all else fails, consider increasing the timeout limit for the test case, although this should only be a temporary fix and not a long-term solution.",
