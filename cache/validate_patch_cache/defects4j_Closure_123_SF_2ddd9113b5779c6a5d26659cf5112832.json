However, based on the error message you have provided, it seems there is an unclosed character literal in the code. \n\nA character literal is a single character enclosed in single quotes (''). If there is an unclosed character literal in the code, it means that a character is being opened with a single quote but not closed properly with another single quote.\n\nTo fix this error, you need to look at the code line where the error was reported and find the unclosed character literal. This can be done by checking if there is a single quote that is not followed by another single quote to close it. Once you've identified the problem, you can either close the character literal with another single quote or remove the single quote altogether if it was not meant to be a character literal.\n\nIf you provide me with the code in question, I may be able to assist you further in identifying and fixing the error.",
