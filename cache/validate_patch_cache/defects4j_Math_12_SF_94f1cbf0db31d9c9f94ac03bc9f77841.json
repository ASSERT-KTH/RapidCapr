    "patch": "Without access to the original code or more information about the specific issue causing the timeout error, it's difficult for me to provide a precise solution. However, here are some general tips on how to fix a timeout error:\n\n1. Decrease the timeout period: If the test is taking too long to run, try decreasing the timeout period to see if it resolves the issue. This can be done by specifying a shorter timeout value in the test case.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If the code being tested is taking too long to run, try optimizing it by analyzing its performance and identifying potential bottlenecks. This can be done by using profiling tools or code analysis tools.\n\n3. Simplify the test case: If the test case is too complex or has too many dependencies, try simplifying it to make it easier to debug and understand. This can be done by analyzing the dependencies and identifying which ones are necessary for the test to run.\n\n4. Increase the resources: If the test requires a lot of resources, such as memory or CPU, try increasing the resources available to the test environment.\n\n5. Re-run the test: Sometimes timeout errors can be due to transient issues, such as network or server connectivity issues. Try re-running the test to see if the error persists.\n\nRemember, timeout errors can be caused by many factors, so it's important to analyze the specific situation and identify the root cause before applying any fixes.",
