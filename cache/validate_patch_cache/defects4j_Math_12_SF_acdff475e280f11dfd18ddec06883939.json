    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. Without the code, I cannot provide a solution that will definitely fix the problem. However, a timeout error typically suggests that the function is taking too long to complete and needs to be optimized.\n\nHere are a few possible techniques for optimizing a slow function:\n\n1. Identify the bottleneck in the function and focus on optimizing that portion first (e.g. if there is a loop that is taking a long time to complete, work on optimizing that loop).\n2. Use more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n3. Look for repeated calculations or operations and try to reduce or eliminate them.\n4. Make sure that any loops have an exit condition to prevent an infinite loop.\n5. Consider using multi-threading or parallelism to split up work and decrease overall execution time.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code that is timing out and any relevant context, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
