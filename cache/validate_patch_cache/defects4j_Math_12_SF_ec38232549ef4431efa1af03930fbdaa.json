    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the fix did not work. Unfortunately, without seeing the actual code and the context in which the error occurs, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution to the issue. \n\nHowever, you may try some of the following techniques to resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. Simplify the testing scenarios - If the tests are too complex, reduce the complexity of the input and output data. \n2. Use better data structures - If the test involves a large amount of data, consider using more efficient data structures.\n3. Optimize the algorithm - Ensure that the algorithm is optimized to handle the input data efficiently.\n4. Check for infinite loops - Make sure that there are no infinite loops in the code.\n5. Increase the timeout value - If possible, increase the timeout value of the test.\n\nIf the issue still persists, please provide more information about the code, the test cases, and the environment in which they are executed.",
