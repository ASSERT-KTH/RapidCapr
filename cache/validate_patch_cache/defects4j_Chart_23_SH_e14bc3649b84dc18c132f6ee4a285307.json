    "patch": "Without seeing the context of the code and the exact line where the error occurs, it is difficult to provide a specific hunk to fix the issue. However, typically, when you see the error \"';' expected,\" it means that there is a syntax error in the code, and a semicolon might be missing at the end of a statement or declaration. \n\nHere are some possible fixes that you could try:\n\n1. Check if all statements are properly terminated with semicolons. For example, if you have a statement like `int x = 0` followed by another statement on the same line, you might need to add a semicolon at the end of the first statement: `int x = 0; anotherStatement();`\n\n2. Check if all code blocks are properly closed with closing braces (`}`). For example, if you have an if statement, make sure that the opening brace `{` is followed by a closing brace `}` that properly encloses the code block.\n\n3. Check if all variable and method declarations have the correct syntax. For example, make sure that you have included the correct type, name, and parameters for each declaration.\n\nOnce you have fixed the syntax error, you should be able to compile your code successfully and run the tests without any further errors.",
