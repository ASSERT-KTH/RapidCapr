    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the specific details of the code and the test cases, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, I can suggest a few general strategies for addressing this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Take a closer look at the algorithm and identify areas of inefficiency and opportunities for optimization. Re-write those sections of the code.\n\n2. Reduce input data: Test the code on smaller or less complex data. If the code works quickly on smaller data sets, then this can help identify inefficiencies.\n\n3. Enhance the hardware: Consider upgrading the hardware on which the code is running. This can especially be helpful for large data sets and complex algorithms. \n\n4. Employ parallelism: If possible, implement the current algorithm with parallelization to improve its performance.\n\nFinally, consider using profiling and debugging tools to gain insight into the performance of the code. These can highlight any bottlenecks and provide insight on how to fix them. I hope this helps!",
