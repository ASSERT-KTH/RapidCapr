    "patch": "I apologize for my previous response. Since you have not provided the code, I will provide you with a generic solution to the timeout error.\n\nA timeout error occurs when the code takes too long to execute, and the test framework interrupts it. This can happen for various reasons, such as an infinite loop or a slow algorithm.\n\nTo fix this error, you can try the following:\n\n1. Optimize the code: check for any inefficiencies in the code and optimize it.\n\n2. Increase the timeout: some test frameworks allow you to increase the timeout for a specific test. Check the documentation for your test framework and try to increase the timeout.\n\n3. Use a debugging tool: use a debugger to see where the code is getting stuck or taking too long to execute. This will help you identify the problem and come up with a solution.\n\n4. Simplify the test: if the test is too complex, simplify it to reduce the time it takes to execute.\n\nWithout the code snippet, I cannot provide a specific solution to the timeout error.",
