    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the issue. However, here are a few reasons that may be causing the timeout:\n\n1. The function may contain an infinite loop or excessive computation.\n2. The input size may be too large for the function to handle.\n3. The function may be making network or database requests that are taking too long to respond.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or excessive computation in your function, and optimize it if possible.\n2. If the input size is too large, consider breaking it into smaller chunks and processing each chunk separately.\n3. If the function is making network or database requests, consider optimizing the queries or caching the results.\n\nIf you can provide the code that is causing the timeout, I would be happy to further assist you in finding a solution.",
