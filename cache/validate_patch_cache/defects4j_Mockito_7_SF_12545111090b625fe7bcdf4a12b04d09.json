After further investigation, it appears that the issue is not with the `readTypeVariables` method itself, but with the way that `typeVariable` is being constructed or initialized.\n\nThe error message \"Raw extraction not supported for : 'null'\" typically occurs when Mockito attempts to extract generic information from a null object. This suggests that `typeVariable` might be null, or some other part of the code is not properly initializing it to a non-null value.\n\nWithout more information about the context and implementation of this code, it is difficult to provide a precise fix. However, here are some things to consider:\n\n- Make sure that `typeVariable` is properly initialized before this method is called.\n- Check the implementation of `getActualTypeArgumentFor` to ensure that it is returning a valid type argument. It may be returning null in some cases, which could cause the \"null\" error.\n- Consider adding some null checks and/or logging statements to help diagnose the issue. For example, you could add a check at the beginning of `readTypeVariables` to ensure that `typeVariable` is not null, and log an error message if it is null. Similarly, you could add logging statements to `getActualTypeArgumentFor` to see what type argument is being returned when the error occurs.",
