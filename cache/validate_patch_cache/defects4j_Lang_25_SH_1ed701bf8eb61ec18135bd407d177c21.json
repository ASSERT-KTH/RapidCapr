    "patch": "Without seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a specific fix for the removed buggy hunk. However, here are some general steps that can be taken to fix the test failure:\n\n1. Understand what the test is trying to accomplish and what the expected behavior is. Read the test code and any related documentation or comments to gain a better understanding.\n\n2. Reproduce the test failure locally. Run the failing test in isolation and use a debugger or logging statements to examine the behavior of the code before it fails. \n\n3. Once you have identified the root cause of the failure, modify the code to fix the bug. Depending on the issue, this may involve changing code within the test itself or modifying the implementation code that the test is calling. \n\n4. Run the test again to verify that the issue has been resolved. It may be necessary to repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to fully address the issue, as fixing one bug may reveal additional problems or issues in the code.",
