Unfortunately, without access to the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. \n\nHowever, here are some steps you can take to try to resolve the timeout issue:\n- Check for any infinite loops in the code and fix them.\n- Look for any unnecessary or redundant computations.\n- If there is a large data set, try to optimize the code to handle it efficiently.\n- Increase the timeout limit if possible.\n- Use multi-threading or parallel processing if applicable.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code, I can analyze it and suggest more precise solutions.",
