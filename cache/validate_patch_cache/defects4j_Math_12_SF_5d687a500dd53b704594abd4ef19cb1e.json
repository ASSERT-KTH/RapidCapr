    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Without available code in the question, I cannot provide a specific fix for the issue. However, here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or performance issues that could be causing the test to time out. You can add debug statements to your code and use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.\n2. Increase the timeout duration of the test case to allow it to complete. Depending on the test framework you are using, this can be done through configuration files or annotations.\n3. If the test involves network or I/O operations, check for connectivity issues or potential network timeouts.\n4. Check if the test framework used has any issues with long-running tests and consider switching to another test framework if needed.\n\nIf you are still unable to resolve the issue, please provide me with additional debugging information and error messages so I can help you to find a better solution.",
