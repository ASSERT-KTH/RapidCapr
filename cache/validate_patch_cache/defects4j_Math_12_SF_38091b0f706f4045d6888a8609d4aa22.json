    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. To fix the timeout issue, the function needs to be optimized further. Here are some additional tips to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the bottleneck - Use profiling tools to identify which part of the function is taking the most time. This could include loops, expensive operations, or function calls.\n\n2. Reduce the input size - If possible, reduce the size of the input data to make it easier to process and quicker to run.\n\n3. Parallelize the function - If the function can be broken down into smaller parts, consider parallelizing it using threads or other concurrency mechanisms.\n\n4. Use caching - If the function is performing the same operations multiple times, consider caching the results to avoid redundant work.\n\n5. Simplify the function - Consider simplifying the function or breaking it down into smaller functions to make it easier to optimize.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. Please provide the code so that I can help you further in fixing the issue.",
