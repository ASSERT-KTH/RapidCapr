You can also try identifying any nested loops or complex operations that could be causing the issue and refactor them to improve efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, you could increase the timeout value of the test, but this may only be a temporary solution and could mask underlying issues with the code.\n\nWithout seeing the full code and context, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. However, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
