    "patch": "I apologize again for the issue. Based on the timeout error you're experiencing, it appears that the test is still taking too long to complete.\n\nTo address the timeout issue, you can try optimizing the algorithm of the function to improve its efficiency.\n\nWithout seeing the code, however, it's difficult for me to provide specific suggestions for optimization. Some general tips for improving algorithmic efficiency include:\n\n1. Use data structures and algorithms appropriate to the problem.\n2. Avoid unnecessary work, such as duplicate calculations or unnecessary iterations.\n3. Optimize frequently-executed code segments.\n4. Use appropriate control structures, such as early exit conditions, to minimize the number of iterations required.\n5. Thoroughly test and profile the code to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\n\nIf you're still unable to resolve the issue, please share the code and more details about the problem, and I'll do my best to provide more specific guidance.",
