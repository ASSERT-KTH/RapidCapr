It is difficult to provide a solution to the problem without looking at the code and understanding its structure and purpose.\n\nHowever, given the error message, it seems like the code may have an infinite loop or is taking an unreasonably long time to execute. You could try optimizing the code or looking for any loops that may run unnecessarily.\n\nAdditionally, it could simply be a case of increasing the time out duration to allow for the function to execute completely.",
