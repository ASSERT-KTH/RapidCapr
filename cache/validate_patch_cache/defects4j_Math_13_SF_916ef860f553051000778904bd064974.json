This could be caused by various factors such as a large input, inefficient memory usage, or insufficient memory allocation to the program. Here are some possible solutions you can try:\n\n1. Increase the memory allocated to the program. You can do this by setting the `-Xmx` flag when running the program. For example, if you want to allocate 2 GB of memory to the program, you can use the following command: `java -Xmx2g myProgram`.\n\n2. Optimize the memory usage of the `squareRoot` function. You can try using more efficient data structures, or algorithms that use less memory. This may involve changing the implementation of the `EigenDecomposition` class used in the function.\n\n3. Reduce the size of the input used in the `testLargeSample` test case. You can try using smaller inputs that still cover the edge cases you are interested in testing. \n\nWithout further information about the code and its intended purpose, it is difficult to provide a more specific and accurate solution.",
