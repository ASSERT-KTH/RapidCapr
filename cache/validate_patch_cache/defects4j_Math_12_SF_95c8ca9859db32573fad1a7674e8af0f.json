    "patch": "Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the exact issue causing the timeout error. However, in general, here are some tips to avoid timeouts in test cases:\n\n1. Avoid infinite loops or other time-consuming operations in your code. These can cause your test case to run for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n2. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to efficiently solve the problem.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary computations or calculations that can be skipped or optimized.\n\n4. If possible, break your test case into smaller, more manageable test cases that can be run independently. This can help identify the specific part of your code that is causing the timeout.\n\nIf you can provide the code, I can take a closer look and give more specific advice.",
