    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without access to the code, it is difficult for me to determine the exact issue causing the timeout. However, here are some general tips to help you resolve the problem:\n\n1. Inspect the test code and make sure that it is not stuck in an infinite loop or performing an action that takes an excessively long time.\n\n2. Ensure that your code and test cases are optimized as much as possible. This includes using efficient algorithms and avoiding redundant processing.\n\n3. Consider optimizing your environment. It could be that your computer is running slowly or lacks sufficient resources to run the tests.\n\n4. If all else fails, you may need to debug the code and test cases to identify the exact issue causing the timeout.\n\nI hope this helps!",
