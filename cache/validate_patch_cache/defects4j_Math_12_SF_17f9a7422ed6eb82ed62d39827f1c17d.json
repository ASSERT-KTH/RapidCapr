    "patch": "Without more information or access to the code, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. However, a possible approach to fix this issue is to optimize the code to reduce the execution time. Some techniques to consider are:\n\n1. Algorithmic optimization: Review the code and algorithm for performance optimization. Can you reduce the number of nested loops, or use a more efficient data structure?\n2. Timed code segments: Use a profiler or timed code segments to identify specific parts of the code that are taking longer to execute than expected.\n3. Parallel processing: Is it possible to parallelize some parts of the code to take advantage of multi-core processors?\n4. Caching: If the code involves repetitive calculations, can you cache some of the results to reduce the amount of computation needed?\n5. I/O optimization: If the code involves reading or writing to a file or database, can you optimize those operations to reduce their execution time?\n\nIt is important to identify the root cause of the issue and implement targeted optimization to fix it. Increasing the timeout limit is not a practical solution as it might result in other issues down the line.",
