    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without further information about the code, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, as the test is timing out after 600 seconds, this suggests that the code is running in an infinite loop or taking a very long time to execute.\n\nHere are some strategies you might find useful to address this issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Check your code for any possible infinite loops, such as ones with a missing termination condition. If there are any loops like that, add a valid termination condition.\n\n2. Optimize your code: Review your code and see if you can identify any parts that are computationally expensive, like sorting a large array. See if there are any ways you can improve the performance of these parts. One approach is to profile the code, identify the slowest parts of the code, and then focus on optimizing those parts.\n\n3. Divide and Conquer: If your code is processing long lists of data or recursive calls, consider dividing the input data into smaller partitions and process it in parallel. Check if this optimization is applicable to the code.\n\n4. Reduce the input size: If the input data is too large, reduce its size, and test the code on smaller data.\n\n5. Increase the timeout limit: If none of the above solutions work, you can increase the timeout limit.\n\nAgain, without more information about the code and test cases, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. I hope the strategies mentioned above help you to identify the root cause of the problem and solve it.",
