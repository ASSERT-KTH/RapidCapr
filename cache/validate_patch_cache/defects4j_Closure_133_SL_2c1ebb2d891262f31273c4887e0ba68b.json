Since the previous fixes did not work, it appears that the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method requires more debugging to identify the root cause of the issue and the correct fix. Here are some suggestions for how to further debug the method:\n\n1. Check the `stream` object that is returned by `getStream()` to make sure that it is not null.\n2. Check the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method in the `stream` object to see if it is returning the expected result.\n3. If the above checks do not identify the issue, try stepping through the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method using a debugger to see where the code is failing.\n\nWithout further information on the codebase and the behavior of the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method, it is difficult to provide a more specific fix.",
