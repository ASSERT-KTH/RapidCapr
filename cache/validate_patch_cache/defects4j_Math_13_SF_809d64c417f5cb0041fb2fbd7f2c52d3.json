Here are a few possible ways to modify the function to avoid running out of memory:\n\n1. Increase the heap size: This is a quick fix, but not always feasible if the amount of memory required is very large. To increase the heap size, add `-Xmx` flag followed by the desired memory size (e.g., `-Xmx4g`) to the JVM arguments when running the program.\n\n2. Use an approximation technique: If precise values are not required, an approximation technique such as truncated SVD or a low-rank approximation can be used instead of computing the full eigen decomposition.\n\n3. Use a sparse matrix representation: If the matrix has many zero-valued entries, using a sparse matrix representation can greatly reduce the memory usage.\n\n4. Optimize the code: If none of the above options work, the code itself can be optimized to reduce the memory usage. This could involve using more efficient data structures or algorithms, or making use of parallel computation if possible.\n\nWithout further information about the specific use case, it is difficult to determine the best course of action.",
