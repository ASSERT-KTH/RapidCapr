    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. Without seeing the code or understanding the problem domain, it's difficult to provide a correct implementation. However, a timeout error usually means that the function is taking too long to execute and might need to be optimized. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n- Optimize any loops or recursive calls in the function for performance.\n- Consider reducing the size of the input data if possible.\n- Use threading or parallel processing to distribute the workload across multiple threads if appropriate.\n- Verify that there are no infinite loops or other logic errors causing the function to hang.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information or the code snippet, I would be happy to take another look.",
