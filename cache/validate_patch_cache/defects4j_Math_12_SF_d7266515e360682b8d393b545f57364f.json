    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation or understanding more about the problem, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here is some general advice for addressing test timeouts:\n\n1. Optimize code: Review the code and look for potential bottlenecks, such as loops or recursion that repeat unnecessarily, inefficient algorithms, or redundant calculations. Refactor these areas to improve performance.\n\n2. Identify slow tests: Use a test profiler to identify which tests are taking the most time to execute. Once these tests are located, focus on optimizing them to improve overall test performance.\n\n3. Mock dependencies: Use mock objects or stubs to simulate dependencies and reduce the time needed to set up and tear down tests.\n\n4. Parallelize tests: Run multiple tests concurrently to speed up overall test execution. Make sure that tests can be safely run in parallel and that there are no resource conflicts.\n\n5. Increase hardware resources: If possible, increase the hardware resources available for running tests. This can include adding more RAM to a test machine or configuring a test cluster to run tests in parallel.\n\n6. Increase test timeout: If none of the above options work, increase the timeout value for a specific test. However, this should only be done as a temporary solution while identifying more permanent solutions to improve test performance.\n\nI hope this advice helps in resolving the issue.",
