Please find the updated implementation below.\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n    if (a == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    double[] b = new double[a.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        b[i] = a[i];\n    }\n    return b;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation includes a null check for the input argument, which is a best practice for defensive programming. It also ensures that each element of `a` is copied over to the new array `b` using a for-loop.\n\nPlease let me know if this solution works for you.",
