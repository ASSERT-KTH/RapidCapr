    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. Without knowing the specific code, I cannot provide a working solution. However, I can suggest some debugging techniques that may help you to identify the root cause of the issue:\n\n1. Review the error messages, stack traces, and log files to identify the specific point in the code where the issue is occurring. \n2. Use a debugger to step through the code and identify any issues with variable values or code logic.\n3. Use profiling tools to identify any performance bottlenecks or memory leaks that may be causing the issue.\n4. Simplify the code by removing unnecessary sections or breaking it down into smaller, modular components that can be tested separately.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. If you can provide me with more information or specific error messages, I may be able to provide a more tailored solution.",
