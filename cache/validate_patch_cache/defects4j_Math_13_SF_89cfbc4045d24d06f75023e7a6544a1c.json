    "patch": "It is difficult to provide a specific fix without more information, but here are some general suggestions for addressing the bugs:\n\n1. In the `multiply` function, the issue seems to be that the function is not handling the case when `x` is outside of a certain range. The suggested fix checks if `x` is between 0 and `RADIX` (presumably a constant defined elsewhere), and if so, calls `multiplyFast(x)`. Otherwise, it calls `multiply(newInstance(x))`, which is not shown here but presumably handles the multiplication using a more general algorithm.\n\n2. In the `squareRoot` function, the issue seems to be that the function is running out of memory when processing a large sample. One possible fix could be to use a streaming approach that processes the sample in chunks, instead of trying to process the entire matrix at once. Another fix could be to increase the JVM heap space using command line arguments, although this may not be a long-term solution if the sample size continues to grow. Additionally, it may be worth investigating whether the EigenDecomposition algorithm can be optimized or replaced with a more memory-efficient algorithm.",
