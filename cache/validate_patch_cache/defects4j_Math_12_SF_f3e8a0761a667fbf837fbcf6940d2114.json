    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, based on the error you have provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to execute and eventually timing out. This may be due to the implementation of the function or issues with the test environment. \n\nHere are some generic tips to improve code performance:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Review the algorithm used in the function and consider optimizing it, if possible.\n2. Reduce the size of input data: If it is possible to reduce the size of input data without affecting the functionality, that can also help in improving performance.\n3. Use efficient data structures: Consider using data structures like maps or sets if they can be used instead of linear search or other inefficient data structures.\n4. Cache frequently used data: If there are frequent queries for a particular data set, cache the data for quick access and improved performance.\n\nAgain, I apologize for not being able to provide a specific solution. If you provide the relevant code and more details about the error, I will try to assist you further.",
