    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that did not work for you. Please try the following implementation:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double d : distribution) {\n        sum += d;\n    }\n\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return new double[distribution.length];\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the cases of a null or empty `distribution` input array, as well as a case where all the values in the array are 0.\n\nThe implementation uses a traditional for loop to sum up the elements in the array and then divide each element by the sum to create a new array with normalized values.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
