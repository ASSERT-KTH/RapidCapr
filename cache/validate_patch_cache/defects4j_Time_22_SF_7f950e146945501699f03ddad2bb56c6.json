Here is an updated version of the `BasePeriod` constructor that should fix the original test failure:\n```\nprotected BasePeriod(long duration) {\n    this(new Duration(duration), PeriodType.standard().withMillisRemoved().withWeeksRemoved(), ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC());\n}\n```\nThis constructor creates a period with standard precision, removes milliseconds precision using the `withMillisRemoved()` method, and removes weeks precision using the `withWeeksRemoved()` method. The period is then constructed using `ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC()` method to use the UTC time zone.\n\nI hope this solution resolves your issue.
