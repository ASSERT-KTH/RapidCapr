    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working. Without access to the code, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Consider using a debugger to step through the code and see where it gets stuck.\n2. If there is a timeout, it could indicate that there is an infinite loop or long-running process. You may need to optimize the code to prevent this.\n3. Make sure all variables are initialized properly, and that there are no null pointers or out-of-bounds errors.\n4. Double-check any external dependencies or API calls to ensure they are working as expected.\n5. Consider breaking the code down into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be tested and debugged separately.\n\nIf you could provide me with more specific information about the code and the error messages, I may be able to provide a more targeted solution.",
