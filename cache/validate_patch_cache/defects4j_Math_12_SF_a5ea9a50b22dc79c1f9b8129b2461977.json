    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incomplete answer. Given the timeout error, it's possible that the function may have performance issues. Without the original code and additional context, it's difficult to determine the root cause.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general strategies to optimize the code:\n\n1. Consider evaluating if a more efficient data structure can replace an array or list.\n2. Look for unnecessary looping and see if it can be eliminated.\n3. If possible, evaluate if certain calculations can be pre-computed or cached to save time.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and contexts so I can better assist you.",
