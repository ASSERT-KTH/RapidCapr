    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and identifying the root cause of the timeout error, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips and techniques to address timeout errors:\n\n1. Check the complexity of the code. If the code is too complex and time-consuming, consider refactoring it to make it more efficient.\n2. Use optimized data structures. Some data structures, such as arrays, may be faster than others, such as linked lists.\n3. Optimize loops. Avoid unnecessary iterations, use early exit conditions, and reduce function calls inside loops.\n4. Parallelize code execution. Often, code can be parallelized to speed up the execution time. Consider using multithreading if possible.\n5. Use profiling tools. Profiling tools can help identify bottlenecks in the code.\n\nI hope these tips help you fix the timeout issue in your code.",
