It is difficult to provide a correct function without seeing the original code, the full test file, and understanding the requirements of the code. \n\nHowever, the fact that the test is timing out suggests that there may be an issue with the performance of the function. If you can provide more information, I may be able to suggest further improvements to fix the issue.",
