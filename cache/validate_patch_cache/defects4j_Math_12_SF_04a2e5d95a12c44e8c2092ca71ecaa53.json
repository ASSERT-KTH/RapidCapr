Without more information on the code and the specific error, I am unable to provide a precise solution. \n\nHowever, if your test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is possible that the code contains an algorithm with high time complexity. \n\nOne solution could be to optimize the algorithm or use a more efficient data structure. Another option could be to increase the time limit for the test to run.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could provide me with the code that is causing the timeout error, so I can provide a more specific solution.",
