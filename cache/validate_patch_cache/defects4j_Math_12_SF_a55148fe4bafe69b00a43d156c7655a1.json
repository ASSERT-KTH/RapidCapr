    "patch": "I apologize for my previous attempts. Without seeing the full code and context of the issue, it is difficult to provide a definitive solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it looks like the test is timing out and not completing execution within the allotted time of 600 seconds.\n\nThis could be caused by a number of issues, such as inefficient code, long-running computations, or potential infinite loops. The most effective approach would likely be to profile the code and identify any potential bottlenecks or points of inefficiency and optimize those areas.\n\nIn the meantime, you may consider increasing the maximum allowable test execution time, or splitting the test into smaller, more targeted tests that can complete within the current time limit.\n\nAlternatively, you could try simplifying the test case to focus on a smaller subset of functionality and gradually build up to the full test case once that smaller subset is working correctly.\n\nAgain, without more information about the code itself and the specific requirements and constraints of the problem you are trying to solve, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
