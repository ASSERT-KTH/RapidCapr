    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like there might be an issue with the test or the environment itself.\n\nWithout more information about the code and the test, it is difficult for me to provide a solution that will specifically address this issue. However, here are some general steps that you can take to try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Make sure that the test is not taking an excessive amount of time to complete. Consider reducing the size of the input data, or simplifying the test itself.\n\n2. Check if there are any resources or dependencies that are not being freed up properly, causing the test to hang indefinitely. Consider using a profiling tool to debug any resource-related issues.\n\n3. Verify that the environment is set up correctly. Check if there are any missing dependencies or configuration issues that may be causing the test to fail.\n\n4. Try running the test on a different machine or environment to see if the issue persists.",
