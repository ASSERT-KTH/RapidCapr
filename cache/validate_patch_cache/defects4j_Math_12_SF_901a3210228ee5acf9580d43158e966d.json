    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide the correct solution for the timeout error. However, I can suggest some general strategies that could help you fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code by removing any unnecessary loops or recursive calls.\n\n2. Use efficient data structures for searching, sorting, or storing data.\n\n3. Use parallel processing or multi-threading to speed up the execution time.\n\n4. Check if there is any infinite or long-running loop that is causing the code to hang.\n\n5. Test the code with smaller inputs to see if the issue occurs only with larger inputs.\n\n6. Use profiling tools to identify the bottleneck in the code.\n\n7. Consider rewriting the code with a different approach if the issue persists.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue.",
