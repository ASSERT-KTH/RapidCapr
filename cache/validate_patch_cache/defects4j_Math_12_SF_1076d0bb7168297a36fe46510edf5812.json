    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Without having the code available to me, it's difficult to provide a correct solution. Based on the error message, it seems like the test is taking too long to complete, possibly because the function is taking longer than expected to execute.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. Review the algorithm and code for performance issues or possible infinite loops.\n2. Consider optimizing the algorithm and data structures used in the function to improve performance.\n3. If there are multiple test cases, try to isolate the one that is causing the timeout and focus on fixing the issue there first.\n4. Try increasing the timeout limit for the test to see if that resolves the issue. However, keep in mind that increasing the timeout might not be a permanent solution and may only postpone the problem.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details or context about the code and the issue you are facing, I would be happy to try to offer more specific suggestions.",
