    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. Without specific information on the code and test cases, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, based on the timeout error, it appears that the code is taking far too long to execute. Here are some potential strategies to address this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for inefficiencies and redundant computations. Simplify the code where possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce the size of input data: If feasible, test the code on smaller test cases to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nAgain, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. I apologize for any inconvenience and I hope these strategies help in resolving the issue.",
