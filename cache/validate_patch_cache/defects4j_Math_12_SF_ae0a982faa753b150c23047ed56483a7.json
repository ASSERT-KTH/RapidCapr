    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without any code, I cannot provide a specific solution to the timeout issue you're facing. \n\nHowever, here are a few general tips to resolve a timeout issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops in your code - Sometimes, a logical error in your code might cause your program to enter an infinite loop, leading to a timeout. Identifying and fixing these infinite loops should resolve the timeout issue.\n2. Optimize your code - If your program has large time complexities, it can take a long time to execute for large inputs. Try optimizing your code by using better algorithms, data structures and programming techniques to make it faster.\n3. Increase the timeout limit - Sometimes, your program may be taking longer than expected due to a slow network or other factors outside your control. In such cases, you can try increasing the timeout limit for your program.\n4. Split your code - If your program carries out multiple complex tasks, try splitting the tasks into smaller ones and execute them iteratively to avoid the timeout issue.\n\nI hope these tips will help you resolve the timeout issue. If you can provide the code or additional details about the problem, I would be happy to help you further.",
