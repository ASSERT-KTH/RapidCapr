    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution didn't work either. Without seeing the code causing the issue, it's difficult to provide a correct solution. The fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds indicates that there may be some inefficiency in the code that needs to be addressed. \n\nHere are a few suggestions to fix the problem:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for any unnecessary loops or calculations that might be causing the code to run slower and optimize those parts.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: Decrease the size of the input data to see if that helps reduce the execution time. \n\n3. Use parallel processing: If possible, try to parallelize the code to take advantage of multiple cores and run the code faster.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: Increase the timeout limit to a higher value if possible, to see if the code eventually finishes. However, this is not recommended as it only masks the problem instead of fixing it.\n\nIf you provide the code that is causing the timeout, I would be more than happy to help you figure out a solution.",
