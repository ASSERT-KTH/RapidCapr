    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it's likely that the function is still not optimized enough to handle larger inputs. One possible solution is to improve the algorithm's time complexity so that it can handle larger inputs more efficiently.\n\nWithout greater context or information on the specific algorithm at work, it's difficult to provide a concrete solution. However, there are a few general strategies you could consider to optimize performance:\n\n1. Use dynamic programming techniques to avoid recomputation of common intermediate results.\n2. Explore the possibility of parallelizing the algorithm, if feasible.\n3. Optimize data structures, such as using hash tables or trees to improve search or retrieval times.\n4. Eliminate unnecessary loops or iterations wherever possible.\n\nIt's also worth checking if there are any system resource issues, such as insufficient memory or a bottleneck in I/O operations, that may be contributing to the timeout.\n\nUltimately, the best approach will depend on the specific details of the algorithm and the context in which it's operating.",
