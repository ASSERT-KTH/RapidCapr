However, based on the error message, it appears that the test is taking longer than the allowed time limit. \n\nThis could be due to a number of factors, including inefficient algorithm complexity or an endless loop. If you can provide more information about the code and test case, I may be able to help you further.\n\nPlease provide the code and the test case so I can better assist you.",
