    "patch": "I apologize for the previous mistake. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide the exact solution for the issue. However, the error message suggests that the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out after 600 seconds. This could potentially be due to an infinite loop or a slow algorithmic implementation.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that may help to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: If the function contains a loop, make sure that it has an exit condition and that the condition is met at some point during execution.\n\n2. Optimize the algorithm: Review the algorithm used in the function to make sure that is following best practices and has no redundant code. Use of a better algorithm may help to reduce the time taken to execute the function.\n\n3. Perform unit tests: To identify the exact test that is taking too long to execute, you can perform unit tests for each individual test case. This will help you to narrow down the issue and find the root cause more quickly.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value: You can try increasing the timeout value for the test to give it more time to execute. However, this is just a temporary solution and you should still try to identify the root cause of the issue.\n\nAgain, without seeing the actual code in question, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
