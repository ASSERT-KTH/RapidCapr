Without further context and information about the code, I cannot provide you with a reliable solution. However, I can suggest some general strategies to optimize the code and improve its performance:\n\n1. Check if the input data size is too large, and if it is, consider using a more efficient algorithm or breaking up the input into smaller chunks.\n2. Optimize expensive operations such as loops, nested loops and conditional statements.\n3. Ensure that the input data is properly formatted and validated before processing it.\n\nIf you have any further information or context about the code, please share it, so I can better assist you.",
