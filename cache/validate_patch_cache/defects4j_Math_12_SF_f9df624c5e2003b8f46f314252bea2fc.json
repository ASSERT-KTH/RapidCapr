    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. It seems that the error might be due to the test case timing out, and not an issue with the code itself. It is difficult to provide a specific solution without seeing the actual code and test case.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips that might help in fixing this issue:\n\n1. Make sure that the test case is not performing an infinite loop or computation. You can add some print statements to see where the test case is taking too long.\n\n2. Check if there are any blocking operations in the method being tested. If so, consider refactoring the code to make it more efficient.\n\n3. Increase the timeout duration for the test case if possible. However, this should only be done as a last resort, as it might mask underlying issues.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide more information on the code and test case so that I can assist you better.",
