Since I am not able to see the entire codebase and the tests, I cannot pinpoint the exact problem. However, here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Make sure that the `createFunction` method in the test creates a function that returns a number. The error message suggests that the test expected a number but got something else.\n\n2. Check if there are any other missing return statements in the code that could cause this error. Make sure that all paths in all methods return a value.\n\n3. Consider reviewing the logic of `computeFollowNode` to ensure that it correctly handles all cases of transferring control to a \"symbolic return\" node.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further questions, please let me know.",
