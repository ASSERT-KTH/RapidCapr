Here are some general tips to help resolve the problem:\n\n- Check if there is an infinite loop in the code.\n- Verify if there are any external dependencies that are not available or are not working properly.\n- Check if the test case requires a large amount of data or resources that are not available.\n- Ensure that the code is optimized and not taking too much time to complete its execution.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the code and the test case, I would be happy to provide a more specific and helpful solution.",
