    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the specific code and error message you are encountering, it's hard for me to provide an accurate solution. However, here are some tips that may help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or large computations in the code that are causing it to run for a long time. \n2. If possible, try to optimize the code by reducing the complexity or using more efficient algorithms. \n3. Make sure that all dependencies and libraries are up-to-date and compatible with each other. \n4. Consider increasing the timeout value for the test if that is an option.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error message you are encountering so that I can provide you with a more accurate solution.",
