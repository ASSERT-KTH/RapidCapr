However, based on the information provided, the code may be running into performance or optimization issues that are causing it to time out.\n\nHere are some potential strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Try using a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Consider using a binary heap, priority queue, or hash map, depending on the problem requirements.\n2. Look for opportunities to optimize your code by eliminating redundant or unnecessary computations. This can include caching, memoization, or dynamic programming.\n3. Try to simplify the logic of your function by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can make it easier to identify the source of the issue and optimize your code.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and context so I can better assist you.",
