    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. \n\nWithout seeing the actual code, it's difficult to determine the issue that's causing your code to time out. However, I can provide a general solution that can help improve the performance of your code.\n\nOne common reason for timeouts could be that the code is performing nested loops or recursive calls that are not optimized for performance. If possible, you can try to optimize the algorithm by reducing the number of iterations or by using memoization or dynamic programming.\n\nYou can also try to use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.\n\nIf you could provide more information about your code and the specific test case that's timing out, I can try to provide a more accurate solution.",
