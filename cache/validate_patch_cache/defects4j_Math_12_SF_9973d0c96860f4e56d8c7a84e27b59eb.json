    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previously provided fixes did not work. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, I can suggest some possible solutions:\n\n1. Optimize the code: It's possible that the function has performance issues, causing it to timeout. You could try optimizing the code to reduce its execution time.\n\n2. Simplify the function: If the function is too complex, you could try simplifying it or breaking it down into smaller sub-functions. This could make it easier to debug and optimize.\n\n3. Fix the logic: It's possible that there is a logical error in the code. You should carefully review the function's logic and make any necessary changes to fix the error.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If the function takes a long time to execute, you could try increasing the timeout period to give it more time to complete.\n\nWithout seeing the code itself, I'm unable to provide a more specific solution.",
