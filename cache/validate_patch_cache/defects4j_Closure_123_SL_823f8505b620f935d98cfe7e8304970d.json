However, I can provide some general tips for resolving the `illegal start of type` error.\n\nThis error usually occurs when there is a syntax error or a misused language construct in the code. Here are some steps you can take to fix it:\n\n1. Check the syntax of the code to make sure it adheres to the correct Java syntax rules.\n2. Make sure no statements or variable declarations are placed outside the class or method they belong to.\n3. Ensure that the type name that is causing the error is spelled correctly and is properly capitalized.\n4. Check if there is any mismatch in the brackets, braces or parentheses in your code. Ensure that they are properly opened and closed.\n5. Check if there is any missing semicolon at the end of any statements.\n\nIf you can provide me with the full code snippet, I would be better equipped to help you resolve the issue.",
