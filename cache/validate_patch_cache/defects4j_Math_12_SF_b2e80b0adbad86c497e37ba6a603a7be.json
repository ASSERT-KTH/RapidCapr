    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working as expected. Here's another implementation that should work without timing out:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] dp = new double[n];\n    double[] newDp = new double[n];\n    Arrays.fill(dp, 1.0 / n);\n    while (m-- > 0) {\n        Arrays.fill(newDp, 0);\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                newDp[(j + k) % n] += dp[j] * distribution[k] / n;\n            }\n        }\n        System.arraycopy(newDp, 0, dp, 0, n);\n    }\n    return dp;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation is similar to the previous implementation, but we are using a single array instead of a 2D array to store the probability distributions at each round. We are also using `System.arraycopy` to swap the contents of `dp` and `newDp` arrays instead of iterating over the array and copying elements one by one.\n\nThe basic idea here is to simulate the process of throwing balls into boxes, and update the probability distribution after each round. We use an array `dp` to store the probability distribution at the end of the previous round. At each round, we compute the next probability distribution by iterating over all the boxes and all the balls, and distributing the balls among the boxes uniformly. We store the new probability distribution in `newDp`, and then swap the contents of `dp` and `newDp`. We repeat this process `m` times to get the final probability distribution.\n\nI hope this implementation works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
