As an automated program repair tool, I cannot optimize the performance of the code. \n\nHowever, some ways to optimize the code's performance can be:\n\n1. Reduce the size of the input data.\n2. Use an efficient algorithm.\n3. Use multi-threading to process the data in parallel.\n\nIf none of these options are possible or fail to resolve the issue, please provide additional information or code so that I can better assist you.",
