    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. It seems like the timeout issue still persists in your code. \n\nWithout the full context of the code, it's hard for me to provide an accurate solution. However, I can give some general suggestions to resolve timeout issues:\n\n1. Analyze your algorithm's time complexity and identify the bottlenecks in the code. Try to optimize the parts that are consuming the most time. \n2. Use a profiler to detect which part of the code is causing the issue. This will give you a better understanding of what to optimize to resolve the timeout issue.\n3. Use a suitable data structure for your problem. If your code is working with large data, selecting an appropriate data structure can significantly improve efficiency.\n4. Check if any loops in your code can be replaced with built-in Java collection methods. This can optimize the performance of your code.\n5. Finally, if all these steps fail, you may need to consider changing your algorithm to a more efficient one.\n\nOnce you have optimized your code and resolved the timeout issue, if there are still any errors present, feel free to share the code here, and I'll be glad to help further.",
