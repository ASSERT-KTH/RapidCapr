    "patch": "I apologize for the previous mistake. In order to provide the correct function, I would need to see the specific code that is causing the timeout error and the context in which it's being used. Without that information, it's difficult for me to provide a precise solution.\n\nHowever, I can give some general advice for dealing with timeout errors:\n\n1. Rewrite the code to be more efficient: If the code is taking too long to run because it's trying to do too much, consider rewriting it to make it more efficient. Look for areas where you can optimize loops, simplify logic, or use more appropriate data structures.\n\n2. Change the timeout limit: Most testing frameworks allow you to set a timeout limit for each test. If you think the test is taking longer than it needs to, you can increase or decrease the timeout limit to see if that fixes the problem.\n\n3. Use multithreading: If the test is running slowly because it's waiting for I/O or some other external process, consider using multithreading to run the test concurrently with other tests. This can help speed up the overall test suite and prevent timeouts.",
