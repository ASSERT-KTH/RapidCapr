However, based on the error message, it seems that the test is timing out which could be an indication of an infinite loop or a performance bottleneck.\n\nHere are some suggestions that might help in resolving the compilation error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops in the code and ensure that the code terminates within a reasonable time.\n2. Increase the timeout limit of the test if possible.\n3. Identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize the code to improve its performance. For instance, you can consider using caching or memoization to avoid recalculating values or using an efficient data structure.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information on the code and the error message, I would be glad to provide more specific suggestions.",
