    "patch": "I apologize for the repeated issues with the previous solutions. Without seeing the code or additional context, it is challenging to provide a solution that resolves the timeout error.\n\nThat being said, here is a general approach to optimize a function that is timing out:\n\n1. Reduce the size of the input data set as much as possible, while still maintaining the essence of the test. This will help ensure that the function is correct while minimizing the chance of timeout errors.\n2. Review the algorithm and identify any bottlenecks that could be causing the timeout. Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms if possible.\n3. Make use of parallelization if it's available and applicable to the function.\n4. Use a profiler to identify which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute, and optimize those sections.\n\nIf you're still having difficulty resolving the issue, please provide more information about the problem and the code you're working with, and I'll try to assist you further.",
