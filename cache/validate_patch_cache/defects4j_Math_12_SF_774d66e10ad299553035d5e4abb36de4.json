    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake. Without seeing the actual code, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function to fix the issue. However, the time-out error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute. Without additional information, here are a few general tips for optimizing a function:\n\n1. Look for any unnecessary or redundant code that can be removed.\n2. Consider different algorithms or data structures that may be more efficient for the problem you are trying to solve.\n3. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the code and focus on optimizing those specific areas.\n4. Break down the code into smaller functions and test the performance of each function separately to identify which ones are causing the slow-down.\n5. Check for any external dependencies or resources that may be causing delays or slowing down the function.\n6. Consider parallel processing or multi-threading if appropriate for the problem you are trying to solve.\n\nIf you are still unable to resolve the issue, please provide me with the code containing the bug and any additional information that may be helpful in identifying the problem. I will do my best to assist you further.",
