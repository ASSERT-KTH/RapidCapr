    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, that indicates that the function is taking a very long time to execute or has entered an infinite loop. It's possible that there is still a logic error in the code that needs to be fixed.\n\nWithout access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest a few general steps you can take to debug the problem:\n\n1. Check the function for any infinite loops or other long-running operations that could cause it to hang indefinitely.\n\n2. Use logging or debugging tools to track the function's execution progress and identify where it may be getting stuck.\n\n3. Consider breaking the function down into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be tested and debugged more easily.\n\n4. Experiment with different input values to see if there is a specific set of inputs that is causing the problem.\n\n5. If all else fails, try rewriting the function from scratch using a different approach.\n\nIt's important to approach the problem systematically and be patient, as debugging can be a time-consuming and frustrating process. With persistence and attention to detail, you should be able to identify and fix the problem.",
