    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation of the function, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, if the test is timing out, it is likely that the function is inefficient and taking too long to run.\n\nHere are some strategies to improve the efficiency of the code:\n\n1. Use a more efficient algorithm: If the current algorithm is inefficient, consider using a different algorithm that has a better time complexity.\n\n2. Optimize the implementation: Look for opportunities to optimize the code by reducing redundant calculations, reducing the number of loops, or using more efficient data structures.\n\n3. Reduce the input size: If the function is only timing out on large input sizes, see if there are ways to reduce the input size or break the problem into smaller parts.\n\n4. Parallelize the computation: If possible, parallelize the computation using multithreading or distributed computing.\n\nOnce the function has been optimized, it should be retested to ensure that it runs efficiently and produces correct results. I hope this helps.",
