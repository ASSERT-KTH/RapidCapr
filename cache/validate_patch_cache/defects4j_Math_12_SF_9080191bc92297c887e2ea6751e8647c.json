Without the code snippet or more details about the problem, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate and efficient solution. However, here are some general tips that might help:\n\n1. If the test is timing out, the function might be taking too long to execute. You can try optimizing your function and use more efficient algorithms to speed it up.\n\n2. You can also try increasing the timeout limit for the test, if that is an option.\n\n3. Sometimes, the problem might not be in the function you are trying to fix, but in the test itself. You can try to debug the test code and see if there are any issues with the test implementation.\n\nIf you can provide more details or the code snippet, I'll try my best to help you find a solution.",
