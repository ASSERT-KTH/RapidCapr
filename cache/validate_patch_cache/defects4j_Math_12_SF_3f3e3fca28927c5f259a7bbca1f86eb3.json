However, without knowing the specifics of the code and the test that is timing out, it's difficult for me to provide a correct function.\n\nI suggest trying to debug the code or optimize it to reduce the time complexity. Another option is to increase the timeout limit for the test in question, but that may not be a viable solution in the long term.",
