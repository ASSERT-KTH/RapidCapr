    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fixes not resolving the issue. Without more information about the code and test suite, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Consider breaking up the tests into smaller, more focused pieces. If the test suite is testing a large amount of functionality at once, this can cause the tests to take a long time to run and potentially time out.\n\n2. If possible, run the tests on a separate, dedicated server or machine. If the machine is too busy or is running multiple tests at once, this can cause the tests to take longer than expected.\n\n3. Check for potential bottlenecks in the code itself. Are there any loops or computations that could be causing the code to run slowly? Consider using profiling tools to identify any hotspots in the code and optimize accordingly.\n\n4. If using external dependencies or mocking frameworks, make sure they are not causing the tests to run slowly. Some mocking frameworks can be slow or resource-intensive, which can cause tests to take longer than expected.\n\nI hope these tips help resolve the issue. Additionally, if you can provide more information about the code and test suite, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
