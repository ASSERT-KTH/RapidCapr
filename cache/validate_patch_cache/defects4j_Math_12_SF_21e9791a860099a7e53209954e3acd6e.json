Without seeing the code that you are referring to, it's hard for me to say what specifically needs to change. \n\nHowever, regarding the compilation error with the test timing out, it's possible that the current implementation has an inefficient or inaccurate algorithm, causing it to take too long to execute or resulting in incorrect output. One solution for this issue might be to revise the algorithm to improve its efficiency and accuracy.\n\nPlease provide the code that you are referring to so that I can further analyze the issue and provide a better solution.",
