    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without more specific information about the code and test case, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it's likely that the algorithm is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized.\n\nTo optimize the algorithm, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use more efficient data structures, such as hash maps or binary search trees, instead of iterating through arrays.\n2. Use memoization to avoid recalculating values that have already been computed.\n3. Look for opportunities to divide and conquer the problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems.\n4. Use parallelism to perform the computation on multiple cores or threads simultaneously.\n5. Avoid unnecessary work and computations.\n\nIf you can provide more specific information about the code and test case, I may be able to offer more targeted advice.",
