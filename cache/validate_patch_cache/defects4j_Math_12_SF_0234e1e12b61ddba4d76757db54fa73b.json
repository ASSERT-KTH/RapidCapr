Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the timeout issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Review the code and consider optimizing it for performance. This could include using more efficient algorithms or data structures, reducing unnecessary calculations, or parallelizing certain portions of the code.\n2. Increase the time allowed for the test to run, if possible.\n3. Consider running the code on a more powerful machine or cluster to improve performance.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
