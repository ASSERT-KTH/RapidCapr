This could be due to inefficient code or an infinite loop.\n\nHere are some general strategies to address a timeout error:\n\n1. If the code includes a loop, make sure it has a stopping condition.\n2. If the code makes extensive use of recursion, consider converting it to an iterative implementation to reduce the amount of stack space required.\n3. Check for any other potential performance issues such as large data sets or inefficient algorithmic choices.\n4. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize the code as needed.\n\nAgain, without access to the code, these are general suggestions. If you could provide the code, I could provide a more specific solution.",
