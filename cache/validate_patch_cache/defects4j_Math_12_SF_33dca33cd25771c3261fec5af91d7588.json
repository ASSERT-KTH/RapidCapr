    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code, it's impossible to provide a specific solution to the timeout issue. However, in general, there are several strategies that can help to avoid timeouts:\n\n1. Reduce the size of the input data, if possible.\n2. Optimize the algorithm being used to make it more efficient.\n3. Use multi-threading to break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel.\n4. Check for and handle errors appropriately, instead of allowing them to lead to infinite loops or other issues.\n\nIf you can provide the actual code, I can take a closer look and provide more specific advice on how to fix the timeout issue.",
