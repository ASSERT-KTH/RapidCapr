Without the code, I cannot give you the solution to the problem, but it seems like there may be an infinite loop or a performance issue that is causing the test to time out. \n\nI suggest trying to optimize the code or changing the approach to fix the time-out issue. If you can provide me with the code, I can analyze it in more detail and suggest possible solutions.",
