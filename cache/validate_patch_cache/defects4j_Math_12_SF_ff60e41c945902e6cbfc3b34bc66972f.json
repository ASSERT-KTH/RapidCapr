    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the complete code, it is difficult to provide the correct function to address the timeout error. However, I can suggest some general strategies to improve the performance of the implementation:\n\n1. Avoid unnecessary computations: Make sure that the function is not performing any unnecessary computations. Check for repeated calculations and see if they can be reduced by caching intermediate results.\n\n2. Use more efficient data structures: If the function is dealing with large amounts of data, consider using more efficient data structures. For example, using a HashMap instead of a list for lookups can significantly improve performance.\n\n3. Use parallelization: If possible, consider parallelizing the implementation using multithreading or other techniques. This can help distribute the workload across multiple threads or processors, improving the performance.\n\n4. Optimize algorithms: Review the algorithms used in the implementation and see if there are any optimizations that can be made. For example, using binary search instead of linear search can lead to significant performance improvements.\n\nAgain, without seeing the complete code and understanding the use case, it is difficult to provide more specific guidance.",
