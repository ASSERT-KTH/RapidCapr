    "patch": "I apologize for misunderstanding your previous request. Here is an attempt to fix the timeout issue:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution) {\n    double[] clone = new double[distribution.length];\n    System.arraycopy(distribution, 0, clone, 0, distribution.length);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nHere, we are creating a new array that is a clone of the input array `distribution`. We then use `System.arraycopy()` to copy the elements of the input array into the new array.\n\nThis approach avoids the use of a loop and should be faster, reducing the risk of the test timing out.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. If you have any other concerns or issues, feel free to let me know.",
