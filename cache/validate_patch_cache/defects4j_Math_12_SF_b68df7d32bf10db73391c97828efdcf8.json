It's difficult for me to provide a correct function without additional information and context about the bug and the code.\n\nTo address the timeout error, it's possible that the function is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to diagnose the exact issue.\n\nI recommend trying to optimize the code, such as using more efficient data structures or algorithms, and perhaps adding some debugging statements to pinpoint the exact location where the function is stalling.",
