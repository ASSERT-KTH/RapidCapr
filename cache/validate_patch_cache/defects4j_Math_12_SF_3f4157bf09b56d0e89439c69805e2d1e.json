    "patch": "If the test is timing out, it is possible that the implementation of the class is inefficient or there is an infinite loop. To fix this, we can optimize the code or refactor it to avoid the infinite loop.\n\nWithout viewing the codebase of your program, it's challenging to provide precise detail on how to optimize it.\n\nHere are some general tips to optimize code and avoid infinite loops:\n\n- Use efficient data structures and algorithms that are best suited for the problem.\n- Avoid using recursion when possible as it can consume a lot of memory and may result in a stack overflow error.\n- Check if there are any loops that are not terminating due to specific conditions not being met. In such cases, adding proper termination conditions like checking if a variable has a certain value can help avoid infinite loops.\n- Avoid using nested loops when possible as they can increase the time complexity of the program exponentially.",
