    "patch": "The test timed out after 600 seconds could indicate that there is an infinite loop or a very long computation time. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips for troubleshooting timeout issues in tests:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Sometimes a condition in a loop doesn't get updated, leading to an infinite loop. Try to add additional stopping conditions to ensure that there is a way for the loop to exit.\n\n2. Optimize the algorithm: Look for ways to optimize the algorithm to reduce the computation time. This could include reducing the number of loops or computations, optimizing data structures, or finding more efficient ways to perform necessary operations.\n\n3. Identify performance bottlenecks: Use a profiling tool to identify parts of the code that take the most time to execute. Once you have identified the performance bottlenecks, you can try to optimize those sections of the code.\n\n4. Split the test into smaller sub-tests: Instead of running one large test that takes 600 seconds, split the test into smaller sub-tests that run faster and can provide more detailed information about the source of the problem.\n\n5. Increase the timeout: If you have identified that the code is running a long computation and cannot be optimized further, you can try to increase the timeout for the test. However, this is not always the best solution, as it can mask deeper issues with the code.",
