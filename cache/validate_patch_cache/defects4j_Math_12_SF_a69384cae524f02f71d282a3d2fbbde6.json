    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The timeout error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute. Without more information about the code and requirements, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are a few possible enhancements to consider:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Review the algorithms being used and consider if there are alternative ways to implement the function that could improve performance. Perhaps some parts of the function can be optimized to reduce the amount of computation required. \n\n2. Use multi-threading: If the function is processing a large amount of data, consider using multi-threading to parallelize the computation. This will allow the function to take full advantage of all the available cores.\n\n3. Reduce the size of the data: If the input data is causing the function to take a long time, consider reducing the size of the data. This could simplify the computation and make it faster to execute.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above options work, it might be necessary to increase the timeout limit to give the function more time to execute.\n\nWithout seeing the code causing the issue or knowing more about the problem you are solving, it is difficult for me to give a more specific solution.",
