There could be various reasons for this such as inefficient algorithms, large amounts of data to process, or a mistake in the program logic.\n\nWithout visibility into the code itself and what it does, it's difficult to provide a specific solution to this issue. Could you please provide the code for me to analyze and provide a fix?",
