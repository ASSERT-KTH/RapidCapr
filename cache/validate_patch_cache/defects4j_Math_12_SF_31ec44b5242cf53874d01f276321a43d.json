    "patch": "I apologize for my previous response. Fixing the timeout error may require a different approach. Please provide more information about the code and the test suite that's causing the error to occur. \n\nWithout that information, I can suggest trying the following fixes:\n1. Run the test separately to see if the timeout only occurs when the test is run in a batch with other tests.\n2. Increase the timeout value for the test.\n3. Verify that the test is not waiting for a resource that is still in use by another thread.\n4. Check the code for any infinite loops or heavy computations that may slow down the test.\n5. See if there are any other tests in the suite that are causing a similar timeout error and fix them first.\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, please provide more information about the code and the test suite so I can provide a more accurate solution.",
