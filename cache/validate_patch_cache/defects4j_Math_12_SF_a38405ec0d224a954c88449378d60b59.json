Here are a few things that can be done to improve the performance of the code and potentially fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Increase the allocated memory for the program to run.\n2. Check if there are any infinite loops or recursive calls that could be causing the timeout.\n3. Optimize the algorithm or database query if applicable.\n4. Parallelize the code if possible to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code or understanding the exact problem, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
