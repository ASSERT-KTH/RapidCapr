    "patch": "I apologize for my previous response. A timeout error indicates that the implementation takes too long to execute and needs to be optimized. Without seeing the code, I can only suggest some general tips to optimize the implementation:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures and algorithms: Depending on the task, using the most efficient data structure and algorithm can vastly improve the execution time. For example, using a binary search tree instead of a linked list can provide significant performance improvements.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary computations: Avoid doing unnecessary computations within loops or methods. If a value doesn't change within a loop, it may be beneficial to move that computation outside the loop.\n\n3. Optimize loops: Use the most efficient loop constructs based on the task; for example, using a for-loop instead of a foreach-loop may be more efficient in certain situations.\n\n4. Parallelize computations: Use multi-threading or distributed computing when applicable to reduce execution time.\n\n5. Use caching: Caching computed values can improve the performance of an application by avoiding redundant computations.\n\n6. Profile the implementation: Use software profiling tools to find out the performance bottlenecks in the implementation. Once identified, optimize the problematic areas of the code.\n\n7. Consider using a third-party library: Using a third-party library that specializes in the task at hand can provide significant performance improvements while reducing the overall code complexity.\n\nPlease use these tips as a general guideline to optimize your implementation, and if you need further assistance, please provide me with the code for further analysis.",
