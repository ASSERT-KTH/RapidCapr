Here's an updated implementation for the `compare` method:\n\n```\npublic int compare(EventState es0, EventState es1) {\n    double timeDiff = (es0.getEventTime() - es1.getEventTime()) * orderingSign;\n    if (timeDiff > 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else if (timeDiff < 0) {\n        return -1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `compare` method calculates the time difference between the event times of `es0` and `es1`, using the `orderingSign` field to determine the order in which to sort the events. If the time difference is greater than zero, it means that `es0`'s event time is later than `es1`'s event time (if `orderingSign == 1`) or earlier than `es1`'s event time (if `orderingSign == -1`), so it returns 1. If the time difference is less than zero, it means that `es0`'s event time is earlier than `es1`'s event time (if `orderingSign == 1`) or later than `es1`'s event time (if `orderingSign == -1`), so it returns -1. If the time difference is zero, it means that the two event times are equal, so it returns 0.",
