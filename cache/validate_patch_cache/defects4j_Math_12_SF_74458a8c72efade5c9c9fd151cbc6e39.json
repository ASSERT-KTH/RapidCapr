    "patch": "I apologize again for the previous solution not working. Given that the test is timing out after 600 seconds, the issue might be related to the performance of the code that is being tested. Here are some possible solutions to try:\n\n1. Optimize the code to improve its performance, for example by reducing unnecessary loops or operations, or by using more efficient data structures.\n2. Check whether there are any external factors that could be affecting the performance, such as external API calls, heavy I/O operations, or network latency. If possible, try to minimize or eliminate these external factors.\n3. Increase the timeout duration of the test. This can be done by modifying the test annotation or configuration file depending on the test framework in use.\n4. If none of the above solutions work, you could try to split the test into smaller, more focused tests that can run faster. This can help narrow down the part of the code that is causing the performance issue.\n\nUnfortunately, without seeing the specific code and test, I cannot provide a more targeted solution. However, I hope these suggestions help you find a solution to the problem.",
