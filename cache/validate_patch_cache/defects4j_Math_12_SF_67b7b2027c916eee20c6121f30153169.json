    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working for you.\n\nA timeout error typically means that the code is taking too long to execute and the test is timing out. To fix this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Optimize your code to make it more efficient. Check for any nested loops or inefficient algorithms that might be causing the code to take a long time to execute. Consider using parallel processing or optimizing I/O operations.\n2. Increase the timeout for your test case if possible. You can do this by setting the timeout attribute in your test annotation to a higher value, such as @Test(timeout = 1200000) to specify a timeout of 20 minutes.\n3. Consider breaking up your code into smaller functions/methods. This can help you optimize specific parts of your code and make it easier to debug if something goes wrong.\n\nWithout knowing the specific code that is causing the timeout error, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, if you share the code, I can take a closer look and provide more guidance.",
