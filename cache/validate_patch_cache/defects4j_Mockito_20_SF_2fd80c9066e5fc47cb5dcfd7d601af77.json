Upon further review, it looks like the issue is not with the `createMock` method but rather with Mockito's handling of inner classes. \n\nTo fix the issue, you can try the following workaround:\n- Extract the inner class as a top-level class (or make it static), and run the test again to see if it passes.\n- If the test passes after extracting the inner class, you can mark the extracted class as public and use it in your test case to ensure that the test still passes.\n\nAlternatively, you can try upgrading to the latest version of Mockito, as the issue may have been fixed in a more recent release.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused and hope that this helps to resolve the issue.",
