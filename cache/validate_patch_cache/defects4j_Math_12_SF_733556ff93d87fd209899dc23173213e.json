    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. The code probably contains an infinite loop or is taking too long to execute.\n\nWithout seeing the code, I cannot provide a specific fix. However, here are some general tips to address an issue of this nature:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops in the algorithm, especially if it involves recursion.\n2. If the algorithm involves a large amount of data, try optimizing it to reduce the number of computations performed.\n3. Profile the code to identify any bottlenecks that could be causing the issue.\n4. Consider breaking down the algorithm into smaller, more manageable parts.\n5. Check if there are any external dependencies (such as network calls) causing the delay. \n\nPlease provide more information about the code and the error message for me to suggest a more specific fix.",
