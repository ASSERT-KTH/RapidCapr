    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. My previous response was not helpful in solving the compilation error. The error message indicates that the infill location expects a class, interface, or enum, but it is empty. To fix this error, you need to add code at the infill location that defines a class, interface, or enum. It is difficult to provide the correct line without additional context on what the class, interface, or enum should be and how it should be implemented. Can you provide more details on what the expected behavior should be and any requirements for the implemented code?",
