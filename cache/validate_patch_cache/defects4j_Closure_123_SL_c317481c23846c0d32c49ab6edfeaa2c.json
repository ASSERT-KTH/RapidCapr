Without having access to the complete code, I may not be providing a solution suitable for your specific situation. \n\nSince the error message indicates that there is an issue with the syntax of a type, it is likely that there is still a problem with the updated code. Unfortunately, without the complete context of your code, I cannot provide a more specific solution. \n\nI recommend reviewing the code and checking for any syntax errors or mismatches with the variable types. Double-checking the braces and semicolons may also help resolve any errors. If you continue to run into issues, feel free to provide more context and I will do my best to assist you further.",
