    "patch": "I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous solutions not working. Without viewing the code, it is difficult for me to provide a precise solution to the compilation error about timing out. It is likely caused by some code that is running for too long.\n\nTo debug the issue, you can try to run the code on a smaller input size to see if it completes within the time limit. Additionally, you can insert print statements at different sections of the code to see where it's taking longer than expected.\n\nIf you can provide the code causing the error, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
