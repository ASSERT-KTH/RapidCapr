Since I do not have access to the full code, it is difficult to accurately determine the issue. \n\nHowever, based on the new error message you provided, it seems that the issue may be caused by a missing or misplaced curly brace, or a missing class/interface declaration.\n\nPlease ensure that all curly braces are properly closed, and that all classes/interfaces have been declared properly. \n\nIf you could provide me with more information about the code structure and the location of the infill line, I may be able to provide more accurate assistance.",
