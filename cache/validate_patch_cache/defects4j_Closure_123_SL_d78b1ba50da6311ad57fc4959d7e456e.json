Based on the error message, there might be a syntax error or a syntactic construct in the code immediately preceding the location where the previous infill line was inserted.\n\nThe correct line to fix this compilation error will depend on the context of the buggy line and the code that comes after it. Could you please provide the current version of the code, including the lines before and after the infill location? This will help me in providing a more accurate solution.",
