    "patch": "Without access to the code or the full error message, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, if the test is timing out, it's possible that the function is not efficient enough and is taking too long to execute. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursive calls that may be causing the function to hang.\n2. Look for opportunities to optimize the function by reducing unnecessary calculations or using more efficient data structures.\n3. Consider breaking the function into smaller, more manageable pieces to make it easier to debug and optimize.\n4. Review the test cases for edge cases and make sure the function can handle them efficiently.\n5. Consider using profiling tools to help identify performance bottlenecks in the code.",
