    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, given the compilation error, it seems possible that the issue may be related to the performance of the code or the size of the input data.\n\nHere are a few strategies that may help to resolve the compilation error:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Examine the function for areas where it may be possible to reduce the amount of computation required or to use more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n2. Increase the resources available to the program: If possible, allocate more memory or processing power to the program to support its execution.\n\n3. Split the input data: If the program is processing a large amount of data, consider parsing and processing it in smaller batches to reduce the amount of memory required.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Utilize profiling tools to identify areas of the code that may be causing performance issues and optimize them.\n\nI hope one of these strategies will help you to resolve the compilation error and produce the correct function.",
