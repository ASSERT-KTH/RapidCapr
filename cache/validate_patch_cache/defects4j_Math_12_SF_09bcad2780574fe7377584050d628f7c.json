    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. It seems like the code is taking too long to execute and exceeds the timeout limit. Without seeing the full code and context, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, as a possible approach, you can try optimizing the code by taking a closer look at the loops and conditionals to reduce the time complexity and improve the performance.\n\nAnother option could be increasing the timeout limit. But this should be done cautiously and only after taking into account the potential risks and drawbacks.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information and context about the code, I would be glad to assist you further.",
