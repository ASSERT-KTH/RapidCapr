    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Given the compilation error, it is likely that the issue is not with the function itself, but with the test case. \n\nIt is possible that the test case is taking too long to execute, causing the timeout error. You can try increasing the timeout duration of the test case, or optimizing the function to improve its performance. \n\nWithout more information about the code and the specific test case that is failing, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution. Please provide more information or the code, and I will do my best to help you.",
