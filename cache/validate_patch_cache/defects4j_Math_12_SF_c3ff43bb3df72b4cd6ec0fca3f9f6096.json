    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous suggestion did not work either. Given the timeout error, it's likely that there is a performance issue in the code. Here are some potential fixes that may help:\n\n1. Review the code to see if there are any slow or inefficient operations. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize the code. Possible sources of slowness include nested loops, expensive database queries, and inefficient algorithms.\n\n2. Consider using asynchronous code where possible. If a particular operation is taking a long time to complete, it could be run asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit for the test, if possible. However, this may not be ideal as it can mask underlying performance issues.\n\n4. Divide the test into smaller, more focused tests. This may help to isolate the source of the performance issue and make it easier to identify a fix.\n\nWithout more information about the code and the specific test, it's difficult to provide a more targeted fix. If you could provide that information, I would be happy to help you further.",
