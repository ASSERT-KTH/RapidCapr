Without the code or more information on the nature of the problem, it is difficult for me to determine the issue and provide a solution. \n\nIt appears the test is timing out after 10 minutes. This may be an indication of a performance issue. You may want to investigate further into the code and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies that are causing the slow execution. \n\nAlternatively, you may want to increase the timeout limit for the test. Depending on the testing framework you are using, you can typically do this by modifying the timeout parameter when defining the test case. \n\nIf you provide more information about the code and the test, I may be able to provide better assistance.",
