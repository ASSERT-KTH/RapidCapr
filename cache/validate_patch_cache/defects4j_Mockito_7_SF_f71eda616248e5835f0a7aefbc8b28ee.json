Another possible solution is to add the `org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker` file under `src/test/resources/mockito-extensions/` with the following content:\n\n```\nmock-maker-inline\n```\n\nThis forces Mockito to use the inline mock maker, which may solve the issue with raw type extraction.\n\nAlternatively, if we cannot use a different version of Mockito, we may need to refactor our code to avoid any problematic raw type extractions.
