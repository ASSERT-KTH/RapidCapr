    "patch": "I apologize for not being able to provide a corrected function without seeing the actual code. However, based on the timeout error you are experiencing, it is possible that the function may have some performance issues. Here are some general tips to optimize the performance of your code:\n\n1. Avoid nested loops whenever possible, as they can significantly slow down your program.\n\n2. Use efficient data structures that allow for quick search and retrieval of data, such as sets, maps, and hash tables.\n\n3. Use dynamic programming techniques to avoid redundant calculations and optimize your recursive algorithms.\n\n4. Consider parallel programming if your application can benefit from it.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the code and the problem you are trying to solve, I would be happy to help you with a more specific solution.",
