Without being able to see the code, it's difficult for me to determine the cause of the issue. \n\nHowever, based on the error message, it seems that the test is taking too long to execute, and may be stuck in an infinite loop or running too many iterations. \n\nI suggest reviewing the code and test cases to ensure that they are appropriately testing the intended behavior and not causing excessive resource usage. \n\nIf you provide me with more details or the code itself, I may be able to provide more specific guidance.",
