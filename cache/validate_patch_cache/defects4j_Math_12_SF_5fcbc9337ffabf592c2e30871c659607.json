    "patch": "I am sorry for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code, I cannot provide you with a definitive solution. However, I can suggest some steps that you can follow to identify and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check if the code is stuck in an infinite loop or performing an expensive computation that takes a lot of time. If yes, optimize the code to avoid such situations.\n\n2. Check if there are any resource leaks in the code. Resource leaks can cause the code to slow down over time, causing timeouts. Make sure to close all resources (such as file handles and network connections) after use.\n\n3. Check if there are any deadlocks in the code. Deadlocks can cause the code to hang or slow down, leading to timeouts. Use debugging tools to identify and fix deadlocks if any.\n\n4. If none of the above steps work, try running the test on a different machine or environment. This will help you determine if the issue is with the code or the environment.\n\nI hope these steps help you identify and fix the issue.",
