However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to execute and eventually timing out. \n\nHere are a few potential solutions:\n- Optimize the implementation of the function to improve its performance. \n- Increase the timeout limit for the test to allow for a longer execution time. \n- Modify the test to assess the function's performance in a more efficient way (e.g., by reducing the size of the input data or using a different approach to check the function's output). \n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance.",
