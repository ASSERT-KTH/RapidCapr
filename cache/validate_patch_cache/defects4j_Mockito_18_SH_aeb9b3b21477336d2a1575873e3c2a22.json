    "patch": "Again, without any context or code snippet, it is difficult for me to provide the exact correct hunk. However, I can suggest that the unreachable statement error usually occurs when there is a statement following a return statement. In Java, the return statement immediately exits the method and any code following it will not be executed.\n\nIf this is the issue, try removing any statements that come after a return statement. Alternatively, you may need to add an additional conditional statement to ensure that the code following the return statement is not executed when it should not be.\n\nPlease provide me with more information or a code snippet so I can better assist you.",
