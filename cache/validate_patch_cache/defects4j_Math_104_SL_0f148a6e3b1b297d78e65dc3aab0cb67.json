It seems like I missed the fact that the infill location was completely empty.\n\nPlease insert the following code at the infill location:\n\n```\n/**\n* A small value used as the default tolerance for various algorithms.\n* <p>\n* If the magnitude of the difference between two floating-point numbers is\n* less than {@code DEFAULT_EPSILON}, they are considered equal. The value\n* is set to be about the same as {@link Double#EPSILON}, which is the\n* smallest value that can be added to 1.0 to make a difference.\n*/\nprivate static final double DEFAULT_EPSILON = 1e-9;\n```\n\nThis should resolve the compilation error and fix the failing test.",
