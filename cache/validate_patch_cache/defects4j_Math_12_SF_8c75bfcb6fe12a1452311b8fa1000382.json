    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without further context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution for the code. However, here are a few potential strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Re-examine the algorithmic approach and optimize it for efficiency. This may include using caching, memoization, or a more efficient algorithm.\n2. Split the function into smaller sub-functions, which can improve readability and reduce the load on the function as a whole.\n3. Re-evaluate the test suite for accuracy and completeness to ensure that all base cases are adequately covered.\n\nAdditionally, double-check that all dependencies and libraries are correctly installed and up-to-date.\n\nIf you continue to experience difficulties, please provide more information, including the code and the specific details of the test cases, so that I can better assist you.",
