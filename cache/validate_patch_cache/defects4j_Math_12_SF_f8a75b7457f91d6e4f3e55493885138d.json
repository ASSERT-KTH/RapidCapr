    "patch": "Without the original code and more context about the error, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to consider when encountering a test timeout error:\n\n1. Check the complexity of the algorithm being tested: if the code is very computationally expensive, it may be hitting the set timeout limit. In this case, you could try optimizing the algorithm or increasing the timeout limit for the test.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops or code that hangs: if the code is stuck in an infinite loop or waiting for input that never comes, the test will time out. In this case, you need to identify and fix the problematic code.\n\n3. Check for resource usage: if the code is using up a lot of memory or CPU resources, it may cause the test to time out. In this case, you could try optimizing the code to use fewer resources or increasing the available resources for the test.\n\n4. Check for issues with the test environment: sometimes the test environment can slow down or cause issues that lead to timeouts. In this case, you could try running the test in a different environment or resetting the current environment.\n\nIf you provide more context and the original code, I can provide more specific solutions to the problem.",
