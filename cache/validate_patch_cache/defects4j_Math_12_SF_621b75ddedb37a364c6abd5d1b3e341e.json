    "patch": "I apologize for the issues with the previous attempts. Without the code implementation, it's difficult to provide a specific solution, but I can provide some general debugging strategies:\n\n1. Review the code for areas where it might be inefficient or where it can be improved. For example, some loops or conditionals may be optimized for better performance, or there may be redundant or unused code.\n\n2. Check for potential race conditions in the code, which can lead to issues with parallelization or concurrency. Ensure that any shared variables are properly synchronized and that threads or processes have access to the resources they need.\n\n3. Try running the code with different input values or under different conditions to see if the issue is reproducible and to gather additional information about what might be causing the problem.\n\n4. Implement logging or debugging statements to help identify where the code is getting stuck and what the values of relevant variables are at various points in the execution.\n\n5. Consider using profiling or performance analysis tools to dig deeper into the code and see which parts are taking up the most time or resources.\n\nOnce the root cause of the issue is identified, it can be addressed through specific code changes or refactoring. Again, I apologize for the issues with the previous attempts and hope that these suggestions are helpful in resolving the problem.",
