    "patch": "Without being able to see the full context and code, it is difficult to say exactly what is causing the compilation error. However, given that the test is timing out, it is likely that there is a performance issue in the code or test itself.\n\nHere are some possible solutions you could try:\n\n1. Optimize the code - try to identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize the code to run faster.\n\n2. Split the test into smaller, more focused tests - if the test is trying to do too much, it may be beneficial to split it into smaller, more focused tests.\n\n3. Increase the timeout - if the test requires more time to execute, you could increase the timeout limit for the test.\n\n4. Use a different testing framework - if the issue is with the testing framework itself, you could try using a different testing framework.\n\n5. Review the environment and resources required - ensure that there are no issues with the environment or resources required to run the test, such as memory or disk space.",
