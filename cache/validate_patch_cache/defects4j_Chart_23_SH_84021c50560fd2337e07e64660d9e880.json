    "patch": "Without seeing the context of the code and the definition of `r1` and `r2`, I cannot provide a specific hunk to fix the compilation error. However, in general, a compilation error related to a missing `;` indicates that there is a syntax error in the code. You should carefully check the line where the error occurs and ensure that all necessary punctuation marks and parentheses are in place.\n\nHere are some common reasons for such compilation errors:\n- A missing semicolon in a line before the error\n- A missing parenthesis in the statement before the error\n- A missing curly brace at the end of a block\n\nMake sure to check the line where the error is being reported as well as the lines before it to ensure that the code is syntactically valid.",
