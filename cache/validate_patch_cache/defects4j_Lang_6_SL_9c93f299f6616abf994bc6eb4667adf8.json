Please try replacing the buggy line with the following:\n```\npos += Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\nif (pos + 1 < len && Character.isHighSurrogate(input.charAt(pos)) && Character.isLowSurrogate(input.charAt(pos + 1))) {\n    out.write(input.subSequence(pos, pos + 2).toString());\n    pos += 2;\n} else {\n    out.write(input.charAt(pos));\n    pos++;\n}\n\n```\nThis code increments `pos` by the number of code units in the current code point. It then checks if the current character is a high surrogate and if the next character is a low surrogate, indicating that they form a supplementary character. If they do, it outputs both characters and increments `pos` by 2. If not, it outputs just the current character and increments `pos` by 1. This should correctly handle supplementary characters in the input and fix the original test failure.",
