    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working and for any inconvenience caused. Without the code or more information, I cannot provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that there is a performance issue in the code. Here are a few possible solutions to improve performance:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Identify any bottlenecks in the code and optimize them to make the code faster. This can involve changing algorithms, data structures, or reducing the number of unnecessary computations.\n\n2. Use parallel processing: If possible, split the data into smaller chunks and process them in parallel to take advantage of multiple processors.\n\n3. Cache frequently used data: If the same data is used repeatedly, consider caching it in memory to reduce disk or database accesses.\n\n4. Use lazy evaluation: Instead of processing all data at once, use lazy evaluation to process one piece of data at a time. This can help reduce the memory and processing power required.\n\nIf you can provide more information or the code causing the error, I will be more than happy to help you identify the issue and provide a solution.",
