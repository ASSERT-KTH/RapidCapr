To fix this issue, the code needs to use a more memory-efficient algorithm for performing the computation or increase the available heap space for the program. Here are a few potential solutions:\n- If possible, reduce the size of the input matrix by using a more compact representation or by only computing the relevant entries of the matrix.\n- Use a different algorithm for computing the square root of the matrix that requires less memory. One such algorithm is the Lanczos algorithm.\n- Increase the heap space available to the program by using the `-Xmx` option when running the program or by running the program on a machine with more available memory.",
