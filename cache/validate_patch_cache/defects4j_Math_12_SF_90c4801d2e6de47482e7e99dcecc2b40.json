    "patch": "I apologize for the misleading solution. If the test still times out even after increasing the timeout value, then there might be a different issue with the code.\n\nWithout seeing the code itself, it's difficult to say what's causing the time-out error. However, here are some tips to speed up the performance of your code and avoid the time-out issue:\n\n1. Avoid nested loops: Nested loops can cause your code to run more slowly, especially if you're iterating over large data sets. One solution is to try to use a different algorithm that doesn't require nested loops.\n\n2. Optimize your algorithm: Make sure your algorithm is as efficient as possible. There might be unnecessary operations or redundant calculations that are slowing down your code.\n\n3. Use data structures: Data structures such as maps, sets, and arrays can help you streamline your code and make it more efficient.\n\n4. Use parallelism: If possible, try to parallelize your code to take advantage of multi-core processors.\n\n5. Profile your code: Use a profiling tool to identify which parts of your code are consuming the most resources. This can help you optimize those sections to improve performance.\n\nOnce you have made the necessary changes to improve the performance of your code, try running the test again to see if the time-out error has been resolved.",
