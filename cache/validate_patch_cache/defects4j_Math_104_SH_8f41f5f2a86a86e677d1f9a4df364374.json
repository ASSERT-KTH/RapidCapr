However, if the error persists, it is possible that there is an issue outside the given code section that is causing the compilation error. I would recommend reviewing the code in the file to make sure all syntax is correct and there are no missing brackets or semicolons. If the issue still persists, please provide me with more context about the code file so I can better assist in debugging the issue.",
