In the original buggy line, the distance is computed as the difference between the two numbers, which can be negative. By taking the absolute value, we ensure that the distance is always positive. This is likely the intended calculation and is the most likely fix.\n2. An alternative fix is to swap the order of the subtraction, so that the distance is always positive without taking the absolute value. This is less likely to be the intended calculation, but is still a valid fix",
