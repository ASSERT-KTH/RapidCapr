    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Without additional information or access to the entire codebase, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, the issue may be related to the test timing out and may not necessarily be related to the code itself.\n\nTo fix the timeout issue, you can try increasing the time limit for the test or optimizing the code to improve its efficiency. Here are some strategies that you can try:\n\n1. Increase the timeout limit: You can increase the timeout limit for the test to see if that resolves the issue. In JUnit, you can use the `@Test(timeout = 1000)` annotation to set the timeout limit in milliseconds. For example, to set the timeout limit to 10 minutes (600 seconds), you can use `@Test(timeout = 600000)`.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If increasing the timeout limit is not feasible or effective, you can try optimizing the code to improve its efficiency. This can involve identifying bottlenecks in the code and finding ways to optimize those parts. You may want to use profiling tools or code analysis tools to help identify performance issues in the code.\n\n3. Split the test into smaller tests: The test may be timing out due to the number of test cases being executed. To address this, you can try splitting the test into smaller tests, each testing a specific aspect of the code. This can help to isolate any issues and make it easier to identify and resolve them.\n\nI apologize if this solution is not specific enough. It's difficult to provide a more targeted solution without further information about the code and the test.",
