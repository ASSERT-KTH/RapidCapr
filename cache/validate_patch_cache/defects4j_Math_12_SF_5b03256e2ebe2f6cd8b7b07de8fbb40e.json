Remove or optimize any long-running code: If the code being tested contains long-running operations or inefficient algorithms, you may want to optimize that code to reduce the execution time. This can help prevent the test from timing out.\n\n3. Run the test in isolation: If the test is interacting with other components or services that are slow or unreliable, it may be causing the test to time out. In that case, you may want to run the test in isolation, without any external dependencies. This can help diagnose the cause of the timeout and allow you to fix it.\n\nI hope this helps",
