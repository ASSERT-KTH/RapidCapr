    "patch": "I apologize for my previous incorrect solutions. Without seeing the actual code, it's hard for me to identify the exact problem causing the timeout error. It's possible that the code is simply taking a long time to execute, in which case it may need to be optimized or restructured to execute more quickly.\n\nHere are a few general tips for addressing timeout errors:\n\n1. Try to identify the specific code or process that is causing the timeout. You can use a debugger or logging statements to track the progress of the code and identify where it is getting stuck.\n2. Look for any loops or operations that are executing repeatedly or taking a long time to execute. Try to optimize these as much as possible.\n3. Check if there are any external factors that could be causing the code to slow down, such as network latency or database performance issues. If so, you may need to troubleshoot these issues before addressing the code itself.\n4. Consider breaking the function down into smaller, more modular functions that can be optimized and tested individually.\n5. Parallelize the function using threads or asynchronous operations, if possible.\n\nIf you provide me with more information about the code and the specific error messages, I'll be happy to try to provide a more targeted solution.",
