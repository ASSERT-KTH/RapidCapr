    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Without seeing the code in question, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is timing out and not completing within the allotted time. Here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. Optimize the code: The code may be taking too long to execute. Analyze the code logic and see if there are any possible bottlenecks that can be optimized. Consider using data structures that are more efficient for the task at hand.\n\n2. Increase the timeout value: If optimizing the code does not solve the issue, consider increasing the timeout value for the test. This can be done by annotating the test method with `@Test(timeout=desiredTimeoutValue)`.\n\n3. Divide the test: If the test is doing too much work, it's possible that it can be divided into smaller tests. This can help identify the specific part of the code that is causing the issue. \n\nAgain, without seeing the actual code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
