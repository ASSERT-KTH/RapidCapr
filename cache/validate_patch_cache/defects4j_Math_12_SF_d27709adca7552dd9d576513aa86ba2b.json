    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without the full context of the code and the test suite causing the timeout error, it is difficult for me to provide a working solution. However, there are a few general strategies that you can try to resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the code for performance. Look for any loops or operations that can be optimized, possibly using data structures such as hash maps or binary search trees.\n\n2. Reduce the size of the test suite. If the tests involve large amounts of data, try reducing the size of the data to make the tests run faster.\n\n3. Run the code on a more powerful computer or server. If possible, try running the code on a faster computer or a server with more resources to see if this resolves the timeout error.\n\nIf none of these strategies work, it may be necessary to analyze the code and test suite more thoroughly to identify the root cause of the timeout error.",
