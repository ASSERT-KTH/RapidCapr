Since I do not have access to the code that is causing the issue, I am unable to provide a fix.\n\nHowever, a test timing out after 600 seconds is an indication that there is a performance issue with the code. One possible solution is to analyze and optimize the algorithm used in the code to reduce its complexity and improve its runtime performance.\n\nAlternatively, you could try running the test on a more powerful machine to see if that resolves the issue.",
