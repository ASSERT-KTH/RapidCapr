    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working. Based on the compilation error you mentioned, it seems that the function is taking too long to execute and is timing out the test.\n\nWithout knowing the exact code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are a few suggestions that may help:\n\n1. Check the algorithm's time complexity and ensure that it is optimized. If there are any nested loops that can be combined or any redundant operations, remove them.\n2. If the function involves computing large amounts of data or numerical computations, consider using a more efficient library or data structure to store and process the data.\n3. If the function involves I/O operations, make sure that they are asynchronous and non-blocking.\n4. Consider breaking down the function into smaller, more manageable sub-routines, and test each sub-routine separately.\n \nIf none of these suggestions work, please provide me with the code so that I can take a closer look and suggest a more specific solution.",
