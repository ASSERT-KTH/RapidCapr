Without seeing the actual code, I cannot provide the correct function. \n\nHowever, to address the timeout issue, you can optimize the code by analyzing and improving the algorithm's time complexity. You can also use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and improve the code's performance.\n\nAdditionally, you can try splitting the test cases into smaller chunks to enable faster execution without compromising the test coverage.",
