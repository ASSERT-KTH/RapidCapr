However, I will provide a potential solution that should resolve the timeout issue and correctly clone the distribution array.\n\n``` java\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n  int n = a.length;\n  double[] b = new double[n];\n  System.arraycopy(a, 0, b, 0, n);\n  return b;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation should work correctly and efficiently clone the distribution array. Let me know if you have any further issues.",
