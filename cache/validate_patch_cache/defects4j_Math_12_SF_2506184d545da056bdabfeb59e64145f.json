Unfortunately, without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the timeout error.\n\nHowever, as a general recommendation, you can try optimizing your code to improve its performance. Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Avoid unnecessary computations and use efficient algorithms.\n2. Use data structures that are optimized for the specific task at hand.\n3. Reduce the number of loops and iterations in your code.\n4. Avoid using recursion in performance-critical sections of your code.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to increase the timeout period to allow your code more time to run. You can do this by setting a longer timeout period in your test environment.\n\nIf you would like further assistance with your code, please provide it so that I can analyze it more closely and offer more specific recommendations.",
