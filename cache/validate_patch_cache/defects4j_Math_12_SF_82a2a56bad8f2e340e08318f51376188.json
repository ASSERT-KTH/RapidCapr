To resolve the compilation timeout error, you can try increasing the timeout limit. \n\nIf the same issue persists even after increasing the timeout, then the problem might be due to inefficient code. In such cases, you may need to optimize the code or find alternative ways of implementing the functionality to improve performance.\n\nIf you provide the code for the bug, I can try to provide a more accurate and effective fix.",
