    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some changes that might help to fix the issue.\n\nIt appears that the code is taking too long to execute, causing the test to timeout. To fix this, you could optimize the algorithm and data structures used in the code to make it more efficient.\n\nOne common optimization technique is to use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations. This involves caching previously computed values and reusing them instead of recomputing them each time.\n\nYou could also consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures, such as binary search or radix sort, to reduce the time complexity of the code.\n\nIt's also important to ensure that the code is not running any unnecessary computations or loops that could cause delays. You can use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.\n\nIf the issue persists, it may be necessary to analyze the code more closely to identify the root cause of the timeout error.",
