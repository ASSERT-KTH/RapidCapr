As the exact context of the code is not shared, it is difficult to determine the exact code fix. \n\nIn order to provide you with the correct fix, I would need to see the relevant code. Alternatively, you can try the following steps to resolve the compilation error:\n- Check for any missing brackets or semicolons in the code.\n- Make sure that all the necessary imports are included in the file.\n- Check if there are any conflicting variable or method names in the code.\n- Ensure that the data types of the variables and method arguments are correct.\n\nIf the above steps do not solve the issue, please share the relevant code so that I can provide you with the correct fix.",
