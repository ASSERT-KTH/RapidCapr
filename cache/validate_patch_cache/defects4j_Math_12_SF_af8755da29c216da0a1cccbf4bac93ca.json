    "patch": "I apologize for my previous solutions not working out. Without any code or additional information, it is hard for me to provide a more accurate solution.\n\nHowever, a timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute. Here are some general optimization suggestions that you could try:\n\n1. Check if you are using inefficient algorithms in your code. Sometimes, inefficient algorithms can cause the program to run for a longer time and eventually time out.\n2. Implement a logging mechanism using print statements to identify which part of your code is taking longer than expected. You can then optimize that part of the code to improve performance.\n3. Run your code on sample inputs with the debugger to trace its execution path and identify any performance bottlenecks.\n4. If all of the above steps fail to rectify the issue, try increasing the timeout time for your test case. You can do this by changing the timeout parameter of your test case.\n\nI hope these suggestions will help optimize your code and make it run faster. However, if you can provide the code causing the error, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
