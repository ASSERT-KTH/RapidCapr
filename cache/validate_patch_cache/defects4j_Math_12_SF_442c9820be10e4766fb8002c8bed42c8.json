    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for bringing this to my attention. The timeout error suggests that the current implementation may be causing poor performance - I will revise the solution to be more efficient, while still addressing the issue causing the test failure.\n\nPlease try the following implementation:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    // check for null and empty input\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    // find minimum value in distribution\n    double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n    for (double value : distribution) {\n        if (value < min) {\n            min = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // subtract minimum value from each element and sum\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        distribution[i] -= min;\n        sum += distribution[i];\n    }\n\n    // divide each element by sum and return normalized array\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation first finds the minimum value in the input array, subtracts that value from each element of the array, and sums the shifted values. The implementation then divides each shifted value by the sum to obtain a normalized array.\n\nThis implementation should be much more efficient than the previous implementation while addressing the issue causing the test failure. I hope this solution resolves the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
