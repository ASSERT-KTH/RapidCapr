    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. Without seeing the implementation, it is not possible to determine the specific issue causing the timeout error. However, here is a general strategy for addressing this type of error:\n\n1. Identify the specific test or portion of the code that is causing the timeout error. There may be console output or logging statements that indicate where the code is getting stuck.\n\n2. Check for inefficiencies in the code such as redundant computations, excessive looping, or unnecessary method calls. Optimize these portions of the code as needed.\n\n3. Review any algorithmic complexity requirements to ensure that the code meets the specified performance criteria. This may involve refactoring the existing code or implementing different algorithms or data structures.\n\n4. Consider using a profiling tool to analyze the code's performance and identify potential bottlenecks. The tool can provide insights into which methods are taking the most time and how much memory is being consumed.\n\n5. Test the code on different input sizes to ensure that it scales appropriately. A solution that works well for small inputs may not work for larger ones.\n\nI hope this helps in identifying and fixing the issue. If you can provide more specific details or provide the implementation, I would be happy to offer further assistance.",
