However, based on the error message you mentioned, it sounds like the issue is related to a syntax error. \n\nOne common cause of this error is a missing semicolon (;) at the end of a line of code. Please double-check all the lines of code in the file and make sure they are properly terminated with a semicolon.\n\nAdditionally, please provide more context or code so that I can better understand the issue and provide a more accurate solution.",
