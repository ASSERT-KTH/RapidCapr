Without the code implementation and more information about the function and its intended purpose, it's difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips for troubleshooting code that fails a specific test:\n\n- Check the input values for the failing test case and ensure that they are valid.\n- Use debugging tools to step through the function and understand the flow of execution.\n- Look for edge cases that may be causing unexpected behavior.\n- Verify that the expected output for the test case is correct and matches the intended behavior of the function.\n- Consider refactoring the function or breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces to aid in debugging.\n\nI hope these tips prove helpful in resolving the issue. If you provide the code implementation and more information, I will try my best to provide a specific solution.",
