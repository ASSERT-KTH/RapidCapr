Without more information about the code and the specific test case that caused this error, it is difficult to provide a precise fix. However, here are some general tips that you can use to debug the issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any `static` fields or `static` initialization blocks in the class. These are executed when the class is loaded, and any exception thrown within them can cause an `ExceptionInInitializerError`.\n2. Make sure that all required dependencies are present and properly configured. Sometimes, an `ExceptionInInitializerError` can occur if a required library is missing or not set up correctly.\n3. Use a debugger or add print statements to help you locate the source of the error. One approach is to comment out parts of the initialization code and see if the error goes away. This can help you narrow down the problem.\n\nOnce you have identified the specific bug, you can provide an appropriate hunk to fix it.",
