However, I can suggest some potential strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider breaking the function into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n2. Use caching, memoization, or memoized recursion to avoid repeatedly computing values.\n3. Use dynamic programming to optimize the computation of the value.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and context so I can better assist you.",
