    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and running the tests myself, I cannot guarantee that the function I provide will pass all tests. However, I can suggest some general strategies that may help to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Look for any loops or recursion that may be causing the code to take a long time to run. Try to optimize or simplify the logic to reduce the amount of computation needed.\n2. Check if the code is making any unnecessary API calls or network requests. If so, try to minimize them or batch them together to reduce the load.\n3. Consider parallelizing the code using techniques such as multithreading or parallel processing. This can help to distribute the workload across multiple cores or machines, improving performance and reducing the risk of timeouts.\n\nOnce you have addressed the timeout issue, you can re-run the tests and check if the code passes. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.",
