    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Without more information about the code and test case, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is either running for too long or is in an infinite loop.\n\nOne solution would be to try optimizing the code to make it run faster or to identify the specific conditions that lead to an infinite loop and address them.\n\nAnother solution would be to modify the timeout value for the test. This can be done by adding the `@Test(timeout = <time-in-milliseconds>)` annotation to the test method, where `<time-in-milliseconds>` is the maximum time in milliseconds that the test should be allowed to run before timing out.\n\nPlease provide more detail about the code and test case, and I'll try my best to provide a more specific solution.",
