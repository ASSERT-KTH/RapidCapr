Please check the code carefully and ensure that there are no missing parenthesis, semicolons, or brackets.\n\nIn terms of the buggy line that was removed earlier, please try replacing it with this line:\n\n```\nContext rhsContext = Context.OTHER; // or replace \"OTHER\" with the appropriate value for your specific context\n```\n\nAgain, I apologize for any inconvenience and please let me know if you have any further issues.",
