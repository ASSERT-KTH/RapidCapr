    "patch": "I apologize for the trouble. It seems that the code is taking too long to execute and is causing a timeout error. Without seeing the code, it's difficult for me to suggest an alternative solution.\n\nHowever, there are some general strategies you can use to try to resolve this issue:\n- Check if there are any infinite loops or excessive recursion in the code.\n- Consider optimizing the code, for example by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.\n- Try running the code on a more powerful machine or with more memory available.\n- Make sure that the problem is actually solvable within the given constraints, and that the input data is not too large. If necessary, consider changing the problem requirements or constraints.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information, I may be able to assist you more specifically.",
