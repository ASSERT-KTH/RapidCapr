    "patch": "I'm sorry for the previous response. As you mentioned that the code timed out, it seems that the issue is still with the performance of the code.\n\nUnfortunately, without more context, it is difficult to provide a precise fix for the performance issue. However, here are some general strategies that could potentially help in fixing the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Check for inefficiencies and redundant computations. Simplify the code where possible.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be processed concurrently.\n\n3. Reduce the size of input data: If feasible, test the code on smaller test cases to identify the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Use profiling tools: Employ profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code.\n\n5. Consider alternative approaches: If optimizing the code is not feasible, consider alternative approaches to solving the problem.\n\nAgain, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. I apologize for any inconvenience and hope this helps in resolving the issue.",
