    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working. Without any code or additional information, it is hard for me to provide an accurate solution for this specific issue. However, I'll suggest some general steps you can take to avoid timeouts in your tests:\n\n1. Identify the source of the timeout: Start by running your test suite and identifying which tests are timing out. Once you have identified the tests, you can start investigating why they are timing out.\n\n2. Optimize the tests: Once you have identified the source of the timeout, you can start optimizing the tests to avoid timeouts. Some strategies you can use include reducing the input size, simplifying the test, and optimizing the algorithm being tested.\n\n3. Increase the timeout: If the timeout is being caused by a particularly complex test, you can try increasing the timeout for that test. Most testing frameworks allow you to specify a timeout for individual tests.\n\n4. Use parallelism: If you are running a large test suite, you can try running the tests in parallel. This can help reduce the overall time it takes to run the tests and avoid timeouts.\n\n5. Check your environment: Finally, check your environment to make sure it is optimized for running tests. Consider things like CPU, memory, and disk usage, and ensure that your test environment can handle the load.\n\nI hope these steps help you resolve the timeout issue in your test suite. If you have any specific code or questions, please let me know, and I'll do my best to help.",
