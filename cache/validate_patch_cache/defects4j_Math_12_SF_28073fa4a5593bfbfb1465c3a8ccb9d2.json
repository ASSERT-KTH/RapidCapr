    "patch": "I apologize for the previous answer. Since I don't have access to the code, I can only provide general tips for fixing a function that causes a timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that there are no loops that can run indefinitely. Check for loops with no exit conditions or exit conditions that are never met.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Look for any repetitive computations or inefficient algorithms. Refactor the code or use better data structures to optimize the performance.\n\n3. Reduce the input size: If the function is timing out on large input size, try reducing the input size to a more manageable size for the function. You can also use profiling tools to identify the parts of the code that are causing the delay and focus on optimizing those parts.\n\n4. Parallelize the code: If the function performs computationally-heavy tasks that can be parallelized, consider running the tasks concurrently to reduce the overall runtime.\n\n5. Increase available resources: If possible, try increasing the hardware resources available to the function, such as CPU cores and memory.",
