    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the previous solution attempt also did not work. \n\nWithout access to the original implementation and test cases, it is challenging to provide a specific solution. However, here are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. Try using a more efficient algorithm in your function. Given that your test timed out after 600 seconds, the current algorithm might not be efficient enough. Try to implement an algorithm with a lower time complexity.\n\n2. Split your function into smaller functions to simplify your code. This can help with readability and improve debugging.\n\n3. Check whether your function contains any infinite loops or recursive calls that could be causing the issue.\n\n4. Check whether the test case is correct and has expected values that are reasonable for the input given.\n\n5. If the issue persists, consider running the test case on a machine with better hardware to boost the performance.\n\nIf you can provide more information about your code and test case, I will be happy to try to provide a more specific solution.",
