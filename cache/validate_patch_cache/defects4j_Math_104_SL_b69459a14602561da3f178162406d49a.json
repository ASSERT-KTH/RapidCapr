    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Without seeing more context, it's difficult to determine where exactly the infill location is.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems like there is a syntax error somewhere in the code that is causing the compiler to expect a class, interface, or enum declaration instead of the statement it encountered.\n\nTo fix this error, you will need to review the code and correct the syntax error(s) present in the code. Once the syntax is corrected, the code should compile without any issues. If you are still facing issues after addressing the syntax errors, please provide additional information such as the surrounding code and the full error message to narrow down the issue.",
