    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not working as expected. Without knowing the code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the compilation error provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to complete and is timing out after 600 seconds. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as inefficient code or an infinite loop. Here are a few possible solutions you can try:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops in the code. This can be done by placing logging statements in the loop and observing their output.\n2. Review the code for any inefficient algorithms or data structures. Consider refactoring the code to improve its efficiency.\n3. If the code relies on external resources, for example a network connection or a database, ensure that these resources are available and the code is configured correctly to access them.\n\nOnce you have addressed the cause of the timeout error, you can run the test again to ensure that it passes without any issues.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the inconvenience and I hope this solution helps.",
