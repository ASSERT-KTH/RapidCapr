    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the full code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the timeout issue. However, I can suggest some general strategies that may help reduce the running time of your tests:\n\n1. Implement parallel processing: Parallelizing certain sections of code can help reduce execution times, particularly for CPU-bound tasks. You could consider using multi-threading to run test cases in parallel.\n\n2. Reduce the size of input data: If you are running your tests on large input data, try to reduce the size of the input data or break it down into smaller chunks. This will help reduce the time taken by your tests to run.\n\n3. Optimize your code: Look for performance issues in your code and optimize it to make it run faster. This could involve using more efficient algorithms, avoiding unnecessary operations, etc.\n\n4. Use a more powerful machine: If possible, run your tests on a more powerful machine with faster processors and more memory. This will reduce the time taken to execute the tests.\n\n5. Reduce the complexity of your tests: If you have very complex test cases, try to simplify them. This could involve breaking them down into smaller, more manageable test cases, removing unnecessary assertions, etc.\n\nI hope one or more of these strategies will help you to reduce the running time of your tests. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please let me know.",
