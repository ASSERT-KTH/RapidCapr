    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Without access to the full codebase, it's difficult to know exactly what is causing the issue. However, based on the error message, it seems like the test is taking too long to run and timing out. \n\nOne possible solution is to try to optimize the `multiply` method to make it faster and prevent the timeout. Depending on the specifics of the code, this could involve anything from changing data structures or algorithms to optimizing memory usage or thread usage.\n\nAnother solution could be to increase the timeout value for the test so that it has more time to complete. This can be done by editing the test itself or by configuring the test runner or build system to use a longer timeout.\n\nWithout more information about the code and the specific test that is failing, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
