    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without knowing the details of the code, I can only suggest some general approaches to solving the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize any loops or repetitive operations in the code.\n2. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms.\n3. Avoid performing unnecessary operations.\n4. Parallelize any parts of the code that can be run simultaneously.\n5. Check for infinite loops or recursion in the code.\n\nIf you can provide me with more specific details about the code and the issue you are facing, I may be able to give more targeted advice.",
