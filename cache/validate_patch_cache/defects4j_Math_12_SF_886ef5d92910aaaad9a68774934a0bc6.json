    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the function is taking too long to compute the correct result. Without seeing the code or the specific test case, it is difficult to determine the exact issue. However, here are a few strategies to optimize the function and improve its performance:\n\n1. Use memoization to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times. This can significantly reduce the number of computations required to solve the overall problem.\n\n2. Employ dynamic programming techniques to break the problem down into smaller subproblems and solve them incrementally. This can reduce the time complexity of the function.\n\n3. Avoid unnecessary computations and iterations. Look for opportunities to optimize the function by removing redundant calculations or loops.\n\n4. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms. Consider using data structures and algorithms that are specifically designed to solve the problem at hand, as they may provide better performance than more general-purpose solutions.\n\nWithout more information or context, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
