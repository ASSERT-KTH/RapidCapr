    "patch": "I apologize for the previous failed attempts. Without the code, it is difficult for me to pinpoint the exact issue that is leading to the test timeout. However, I can suggest some general techniques that can help optimize the performance of your function:\n\n1. Avoid using expensive operations - Try to avoid performing expensive operations such as nested loops or expensive calculations multiple times.\n\n2. Use efficient data structures - Use the most appropriate data structures for your application. For example, use a hash map or a hash set for searching operations, and use an array for numerical calculations. \n\n3. Limit the data to be processed - Do not process more data than necessary. Limit the inputs to what is required and avoid processing unnecessary data.\n\n4. Put the most expensive operation at the end - If there is an expensive operation that needs to be performed, try to put it at the end of the function.\n\n5. Cache results - If a calculation is expensive and has been done before, cache the result so that it can be reused.\n\nIf you can provide the code, I will be happy to assist you in optimizing the function for better performance.",
