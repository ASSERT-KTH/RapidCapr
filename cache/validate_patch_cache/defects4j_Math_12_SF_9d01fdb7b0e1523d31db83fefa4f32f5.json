Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Consider optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough. \n2. Increase the time allowed for the test to run, if possible.\n3. Check if there are any infinite loops or recursive calls that could result in an excessive amount of time for the test case to complete.\n4. Run the test on a machine with more resources (such as faster CPUs, more RAM, etc.) to see if the test completes successfully. \n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
