    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the source of the error and provide a correct function. However, if the test is timing out, it may indicate a performance issue in the code that needs to be addressed.\n\nHere are some suggestions on how to improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. Reduce the input dataset size, if possible.\n2. Optimize the algorithm used to process the data.\n3. Use caching to avoid redundant computations.\n4. Ensure that there are no unnecessary loops or calculations in the code.\n5. Consider using parallel processing to take advantage of multi-core processors, if applicable.\n\nAdditionally, it may be helpful to use a profiler tool to identify which parts of the code are consuming the most time and resources. From there, specific optimizations can be implemented to improve performance.",
