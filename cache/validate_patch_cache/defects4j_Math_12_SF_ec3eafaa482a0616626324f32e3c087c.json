    "patch": "I apologize for the error in my previous response. Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the timeout error. However, I can provide a general strategy for fixing timeout errors. \n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Look for loops that may run indefinitely or until a large number is reached. Ensure that there is a proper break condition for each loop.\n\n2. Reduce input size: If the input data is too large, try reducing the size of the input data to test the program on smaller inputs.\n\n3. Optimize the code: If the code is performing a large number of operations, try optimizing the code to make it more efficient. \n\n4. Use parallelism: Sometimes, splitting the work across multiple threads or processes can help speed up the program.\n\nUnfortunately, without seeing the code that is causing the timeout error, I cannot provide a specific solution.",
