However, a timeout error typically suggests that the function is taking too long to complete and needs to be optimized.\n\nHere are a few common techniques for optimizing slow code:\n\n1. Identify and remove any unnecessary loops or operations\n2. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms where possible\n3. Cache values or previous calculations to reduce the number of redundant calculations\n4. Break down the function into smaller, more modular functions that can be optimized individually\n5. Parallelize the function using threads or asynchronous operations, if possible.\n\nIf you provide me with more details about the code and the specific error messages, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
