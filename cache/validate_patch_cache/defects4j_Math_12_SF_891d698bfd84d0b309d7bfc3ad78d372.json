However, a timeout error likely suggests that the function is taking too long to execute. Here are some general strategies to optimize the code, which may help resolve the timeout error:\n\n1. When dealing with large data sets, consider using parallel processing techniques to speed up computation times.\n\n2. Look for nested loops and consider optimizing these using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n3. Consider precomputing values where possible, to save on computation costs.\n\n4. Identify and remove all unnecessary computations. \n\nIf you could provide more information about the code fragment in question, I may be able to provide more specific advice.",
