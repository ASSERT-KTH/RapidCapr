Without seeing the code or having any information about the specific bug, it's difficult for me to provide a solution that will fix the compilation error. The error message suggests that a test is taking longer than expected (600 seconds) to run. You may want to consider optimizing or refactoring the code to improve its performance and reduce the time it takes to complete the test. \nIf you can provide me with more information or the specific code causing the issue, I would be happy to take another look and see if there's anything I can suggest to fix the problem.",
