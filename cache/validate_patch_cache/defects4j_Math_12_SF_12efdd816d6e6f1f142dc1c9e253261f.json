    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. It is difficult to provide an accurate solution without seeing the code and the specific test that is failing. However, based on the error message you provided, it appears that the test is timing out after 600 seconds, which suggests that the function may be taking too long to execute.\n\nIn this case, you may want to consider optimizing the function to improve its performance. Some potential ways to do this might include:\n\n1. Examining the algorithm to see if any sections of the code can be optimized or if any redundant calculations can be removed.\n\n2. Parallelizing the code if possible to reduce execution time.\n\n3. Reducing the size of the input data, if feasible, to pinpoint any specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\n4. Using profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.\n\n5. Considering alternative approaches to the problem if none of the above options improve performance.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code and the specific test that is failing, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. I apologize for any inconvenience and I hope this helps you in resolving the issue.",
