    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Without being able to see the actual code, it's hard to know what could be causing the timeout. However, here are a few general tips for addressing timeouts in tests:\n\n1. Check the test environment. If the tests are running on a shared environment or server, it's possible that other processes or tests are impacting the timeout. Consider running the tests on a dedicated environment or machine to rule out this possibility.\n\n2. Optimize the code. If the code being tested is large or complex, it could be causing the timeouts. Consider using profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.\n\n3. Reduce or adjust the timeout. If the tests are taking a long time to run, it might be necessary to adjust the timeout. However, reducing the timeout might also mean sacrificing some test coverage.\n\n4. Use parallelization. If the tests are independent from one another, consider running them in parallel to speed up the overall test run time.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details about the specific code and error messages you are seeing, I would be happy to help you with a more specific solution.",
