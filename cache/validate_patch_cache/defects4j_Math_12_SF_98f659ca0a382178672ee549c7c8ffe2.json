Since I don't have access to the code, I can suggest some general tips for improving performance:\n\n1. Consider using efficient algorithms for any expensive operations.\n2. Make sure to use data structures that are appropriate for the task at hand.\n3. Avoid unnecessary calculations or operations.\n4. Try to reduce the number of loops or iterations.\n5. Check for any memory leaks or unnecessary object creation.\n6. Use caching where possible.\n\nIf the performance issue persists, you may need to consult with a developer who has access to the code and is familiar with the specifics of the project.",
