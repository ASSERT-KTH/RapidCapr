    "patch": "Unfortunately, I can't provide the correct function without more information about the code and the test that is causing the timeout error. However, a timeout error usually occurs when the code takes too long to execute and does not complete within a certain time limit. Here are some suggestions for addressing the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for areas in the code that can be improved or optimized for better performance. This could involve refactoring the code to make it more efficient or reducing the amount of data being processed.\n\n2. Increase timeout limit: Increase the timeout limit for the test if possible. This may require modifying the test configuration or options.\n\n3. Parallelize code execution: Parallelize the code execution by breaking the task into smaller parts and running them concurrently. This can be done by using multithreading or parallel computing techniques.\n\n4. Use caching or memoization: Use caching or memoization to reduce the amount of work done by the code. This involves storing the results of expensive calculations or queries so that they can be reused in subsequent requests instead of being recalculated.\n\n5. Profile the code: Use profiling tools to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks in the code. This involves analyzing the code to identify which parts of the code are consuming the most resources and optimizing those parts.",
