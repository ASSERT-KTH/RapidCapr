    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a complete solution. However, here's another possible fix to the timeout issue. You can try optimizing the code to make it run faster.\n\nOne way to optimize code performance is to identify and avoid unnecessary calculations, loops, or recursive calls. It's also a good practice to use efficient data structures and algorithms, and to minimize I/O operations.\n\nYou can use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly. Profiling tools can help identify the lines of code that take the most time and the functions that are called most often.\n\nAdditionally, you can also try increasing the memory allocation for the JVM by increasing the `-Xmx` parameter. For example, you can use:\n\n```\njava -Xmx512m YourProgram\n```\n\nThis will allocate 512 MB of memory for the JVM, which should help your program perform better.\n\nIf the issue persists, there might be other factors slowing down the test or causing it to hang indefinitely, and further investigation may be necessary.",
