    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like the issue may be related to the performance of the code. Without seeing the code, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate fix. However, here are some general tips to improve the performance of Java code:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures and algorithms.\n2. Avoid unnecessary object instantiation.\n3. Minimize the number of method calls.\n4. Use caching to avoid recomputing results.\n5. Avoid excessive string concatenation.\n\nYou can also try profiling your code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. If you provide me with the code and more information about the specific performance issue, I can try to provide a more tailored solution.",
