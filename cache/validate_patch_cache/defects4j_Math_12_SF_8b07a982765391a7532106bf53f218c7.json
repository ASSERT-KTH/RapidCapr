    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not working. Without seeing the code that's causing a timeout, it's hard to provide a specific fix. However, here's a general approach to fixing timeout issues:\n\n1. Simplify the code: See if any unnecessary or redundant code can be removed. This can reduce the time it takes for the code to execute.\n\n2. Optimize loops: If the code contains loops, see if there's a way to optimize them. For example, if the loop is iterating over a large array, consider using a parallel stream or using a smaller array.\n\n3. Use caching: If there are any repetitive calculations in the code, consider caching the results so that they can be reused instead of recalculated.\n\n4. Threading: Consider using threads or asynchronous programming to execute certain tasks in the background, freeing up the main thread to continue executing other tasks.\n\n5. Use a profiler: Use a profiler to identify any performance bottlenecks in the code, and use the insights to optimize the code.\n\nAgain, without any code to work with, it's hard to provide a specific solution. If you could provide more context or the code that's causing the timeout, I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
