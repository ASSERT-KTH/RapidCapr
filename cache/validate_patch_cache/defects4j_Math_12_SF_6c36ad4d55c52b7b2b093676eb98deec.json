    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code snippet and the specific test case(s) that is timing out, I cannot provide the correct function. \n\nHowever, here are some general tips that you can consider:\n\n1. Check if your code has an infinite loop or recursion that is causing it to never complete.\n2. Ensure that your code is properly optimized and not doing unnecessary computations or operations.\n3. Check if there are any external dependencies or resources being used, such as a slow network connection or a large file, that are causing the timeout.\n4. If the test times out consistently, try increasing the timeout period or optimizing the test itself.\n\nI hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
