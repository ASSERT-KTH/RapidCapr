    "patch": "I apologize for my previous replies not resolving the issue.\n\nAfter further investigation, the issue seems to be related to the fact that the inner class `Strength` in the test case is a non-static nested class, and when mocking it, Mockito is unable to correctly replace its methods. The issue seems to affect Mockito `2.23.0` but is fixed in later versions.\n\nTo fix the issue, you need to upgrade your version of Mockito to at least `2.24.0`. Alternatively, if upgrading is not possible, you could make the `Strength` class a static nested class, which will avoid the problem.\n\nI'm sorry for any confusion my previous answers may have caused.",
