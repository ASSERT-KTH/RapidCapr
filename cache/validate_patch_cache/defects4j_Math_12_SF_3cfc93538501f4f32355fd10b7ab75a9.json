    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without the actual code that is failing with the timeout error, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to optimize code and avoid timeouts:\n\n1. Use efficient algorithms for time-consuming tasks.\n2. Avoid nested loops when possible.\n3. Try to break down large tasks into smaller sub-tasks.\n4. Use lazy evaluation or memoization to speed up calculations.\n5. Consider using asynchronous processing or parallel processing if applicable.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information on the original code and the test cases that are timing out, I can provide more specific recommendations.",
