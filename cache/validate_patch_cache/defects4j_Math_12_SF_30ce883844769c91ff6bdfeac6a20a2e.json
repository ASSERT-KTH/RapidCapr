    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it suggests that the implementation may be inefficient or infinite looping somewhere in the code.\n\nWithout seeing the specific code, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips for improving the performance of code:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures: Choose data structures that are appropriate for the task and have efficient operations. For example, use a HashSet for quickly checking if an element exists in a collection.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary operations: If a certain operation is not necessary for the task at hand, avoid it. For example, there is no need to sort a collection if you just want to find the maximum or minimum element.\n\n3. Use caching: If you need to compute a value multiple times, cache the result to avoid recomputation.\n\n4. Parallelize where possible: If the task is embarrassingly parallel, consider using multiple threads or processes to perform the operations in parallel.\n\n5. Profile the code: Use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize them.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the specific code and test case, I may be able to provide a more detailed solution.",
