    "patch": "I apologize that the previous fix did not work. Without the code, it is difficult for me to provide a solution. However, based on the error message that you provided, it seems that the test is timing out after 600 seconds. This could be due to an infinite loop or excessive computation within the function.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to fix this issue:\n\n1. Check if there is any infinite loop in your code. If there is, fix it.\n\n2. Check if there are any unnecessary computations that can be optimized. If there are, then optimize your code to reduce the computation time.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value for the test if it is possible. However, be careful not to increase it too much as it might hide the underlying issue.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code, I can take a closer look and provide more specific suggestions.",
