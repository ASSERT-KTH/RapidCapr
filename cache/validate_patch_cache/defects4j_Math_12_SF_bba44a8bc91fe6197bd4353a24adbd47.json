    "patch": "I apologize for my previous solutions still not being able to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, since the test is timing out, it's possible that the function has an issue with an infinite loop or other operation that is taking too much time to complete. To resolve the issue, you can try to optimize the function using the following techniques:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops and ensure that all loops have an exit condition\n2. Identify and remove any unnecessary operations or calculations that take up too much time\n3. Use a profiler tool to identify which parts of the function are causing the timeout and optimize those sections\n4. Use more efficient data structures and algorithms where possible\n5. Consider breaking down the function into smaller, more modular functions that can be optimized individually\n6. Parallelize the function using threads or asynchronous operations, if possible.\n\nWithout access to the code, I'm unable to provide a more specific solution. However, I hope these tips help you resolve the issue and create a working function.",
