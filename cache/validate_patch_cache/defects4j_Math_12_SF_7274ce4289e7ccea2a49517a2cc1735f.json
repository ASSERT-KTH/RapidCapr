Without seeing the code, I'm unable to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, if the test is timing out, it's possible that the function has an efficiency issue. Here are some things to try:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or recursion occurring in the function.\n2. Check if there are any computationally expensive operations being performed more than necessary.\n3. Consider using memoization or dynamic programming to optimize any recursive or repetitive computations. \n4. Use a profiler to identify any performance bottlenecks in the code.\n\nAgain, I apologize for not being able to provide a specific solution. If you provide me with more details and the specific error/exception messages, I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
