    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that the function is taking too long to execute and needs to be optimized or refactored.\n\nWithout more information or context about the function and its purpose, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips for optimizing code that may help:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures. Depending on the data and operations involved, using certain data structures (such as arrays, hash maps, or priority queues) can help improve performance.\n\n2. Reduce the number of loops and computations. If possible, try to minimize the number of loops and computations your function performs.\n\n3. Avoid nested loops. Nested loops can quickly become inefficient, especially if they involve large amounts of data.\n\n4. Use memoization. If your function performs repeated calculations or operations on the same data, consider using memoization to cache results and avoid redundant computations.\n\n5. Optimize I/O operations. If your function involves reading or writing data to disk or a database, make sure the operations are as efficient as possible.\n\n6. Simplify the problem. If the function is performing a complex or computationally expensive task, consider if there is a simpler version of the problem that can be solved instead.\n\nUltimately, optimizing code is a complex and iterative process that often involves trial and error. It's important to carefully analyze the code, identify performance bottlenecks, and experiment with different optimization strategies to find the most effective solution.",
