Here is an updated version of the function that should pass all tests: \n\n```\npublic static double[] calculateDistribution(double[] values) {\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double value : values) {\n        sum += value;\n    }\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Cannot calculate distribution of an empty array.\");\n    }\n    double[] result = new double[values.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {\n        result[i] = values[i] / sum;\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation first checks if the sum of values is 0 and throws an exception if it is. It then computes the sum of values in a simple loop and then computes the distribution using another loop. This implementation should pass all tests including the ones that were timing out previously.",
