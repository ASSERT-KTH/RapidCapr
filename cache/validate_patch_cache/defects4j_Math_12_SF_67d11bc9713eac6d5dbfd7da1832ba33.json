Without seeing the full implementation, it's difficult to determine the specific cause of the problem, but here are some common performance improvements:\n\n- Use efficient data structures for storing and accessing data, such as hash tables or binary search trees.\n- Avoid repeatedly calculating the same values. Instead, store the results of expensive calculations in memory and reuse them as needed.\n- Break the problem down into smaller sub-problems and use divide-and-conquer algorithms to tackle them separately.\n- If the function performs I/O operations, such as reading from a file or network, optimize the I/O to minimize the number of reads and writes.\n\nIf you provide the code, I can try to provide more specific suggestions.",
