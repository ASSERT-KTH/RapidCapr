    "patch": "I apologize for not being able to provide a correct solution earlier. Without inspecting the code and its execution, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution to the issue.\n\nHowever, the timeout error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute and may be caught in an infinite loop or a large computation.\n\nTo improve the performance of the function and fix the timeout issue, you may want to consider the following optimization approaches:\n\n1. Analyze the algorithm and see if there are any redundant or unnecessary computations being done. Eliminate any such operations to optimize the code.\n\n2. Use data structures that are more efficient than the ones currently implemented in the code.\n\n3. Consider parallelization of the algorithm to utilize all available cores on the processor. This can significantly speed up the computation time.\n\n4. Consider using caching and memoization techniques to avoid recalculating the same results repeatedly.\n\nI hope these approaches help in fixing the timeout issue.",
