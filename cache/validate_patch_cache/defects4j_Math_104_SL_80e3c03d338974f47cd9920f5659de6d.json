    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. The error message indicates that there is a syntax error somewhere in the code. Please double-check the entire file to make sure that all curly braces are paired and that there are no missing semicolons or other syntax errors.\n\nWithout seeing the full file and understanding its context, I'm unable to provide a more specific infill location. However, there are a few common mistakes that could potentially cause this error message:\n\n- A missing closing curly brace at the end of a class or method\n- A missing semicolon after a line of code\n- A misplaced curly brace that causes it to be unrecognized by the compiler\n\nPlease review the code carefully and make any necessary corrections based on these potential errors. If you're still having trouble, please provide more information and the full code file so that I can assist you better.",
