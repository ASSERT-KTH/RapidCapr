Without access to the code or specific details about the error, it is difficult for me to provide a precise fix for the issue you are experiencing.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips that may help resolve the problem:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or long iteration times in the code, and optimize the code for performance.\n2. Review the test cases and ensure that they are not too complex or running for too long.\n3. Increase the time limit for the test to run, if possible.\n4. Consider running the test on a machine with greater processing power, if available.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about the code and the specific error message you are encountering, and I will do my best to help you further.",
