    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the specific code and test case, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the test case to verify that the expected output is correct.\n2. Check the code implementation to ensure that it is correct, and try to identify the source of the error.\n3. You can try to optimize the code implementation to reduce execution time.\n4. Ensure that any necessary resources are available or instantiated (such as connections to databases) before running the test case.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide me with the specific code snippet and test case so that I can provide a more accurate and specific solution.",
