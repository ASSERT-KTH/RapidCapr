    "patch": "Without seeing the code in question, it's difficult to provide an exact solution to this issue. However, here are some general tips that might help to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that the code doesn't contain any infinite loops that could cause it to run forever. If such loops exist, be sure to add an exit condition.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Look for ways to optimize the code to make it run faster. This could involve improving algorithmic complexity, reducing unnecessary computations, or caching results.\n\n3. Test the code incrementally: Break down the code into smaller pieces and test it one step at a time, rather than all at once. This can help to isolate the problem and make it easier to identify the cause of the timeout.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value: If it's possible, try increasing the timeout value for the test to give the code more time to run.\n\n5. Use a profiler: Use a profiler to identify any bottlenecks in the code. This can help to pinpoint which parts of the code are slow and need to be optimized.\n\n6. Add logging: Add logging to help identify where the code is getting stuck or where it's taking too long to execute.\n\nIn general, fixing timeout errors can be challenging, since the cause of the error is often difficult to determine. By following these tips, however, you can increase the chances of fixing the issue and improving the performance of the code.",
