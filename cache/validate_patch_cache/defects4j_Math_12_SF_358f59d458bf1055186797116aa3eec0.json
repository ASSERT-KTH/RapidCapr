    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the previous solution is still not working.\n\nWithout any knowledge of the code, it is challenging to provide the correct solution. However, here are some general steps you can take to resolve the timed-out error:\n\n1. Check if your code has any infinite loops or large nested loops that might cause the test to keep running for a more extended period.\n2. Try evaluating the efficiency of your code and check if it's using inefficient algorithms. Inefficient algorithms might keep running for a long time, causing timeout errors.\n3. Implement a logging mechanism using print statements to determine which part of your code is causing the issue.\n4. You can try running your code on a debugger to identify any performance bottlenecks and improve performance.\n5. Increase the timeout value parameter in the test case if none of the above solutions works.\n\nHowever, if you provide the piece of code causing the timeout error, we can better understand the problem and provide a more accurate solution.",
