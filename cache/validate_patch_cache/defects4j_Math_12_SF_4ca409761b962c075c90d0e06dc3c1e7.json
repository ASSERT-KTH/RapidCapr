    "patch": "I apologize for the previous unsuccessful attempts. Without seeing the code and test implementation, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking more than 600 seconds to run, and eventually, the test times out.\n\nThe most likely cause of this issue is high complexity due to an inefficient algorithm. In this case, you may need to optimize the algorithm used in the function to reduce the runtime. Some possible strategies for optimization may include:\n\n1. Analyzing the algorithm to identify slow or inefficient components and optimize them. This could involve replacing slow loops with faster ones, reducing the number of calculations, or using more efficient data structures.\n\n2. Implementing a caching mechanism to store intermediate results and prevent recalculation of the same values repeatedly.\n\n3. Parallelizing the algorithm to take advantage of multi-threading and reduce the runtime.\n\n4. Reducing the complexity of the algorithm, if possible, by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nAlternatively, you could try increasing the timeout limit of the test or running the test on a machine with higher processing power.\n\nAgain, without knowing more about the specifics of the implementation and test, it is challenging to provide a more specific solution. If you could provide more details, I can try to provide a more accurate answer for you.",
