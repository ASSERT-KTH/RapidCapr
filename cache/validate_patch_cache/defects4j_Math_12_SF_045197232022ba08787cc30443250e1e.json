I will provide a new implementation for the function:\n\n```\npublic static double[] cloneDistribution(double[] distribution) {\n    double[] clone = new double[distribution.length];\n    System.arraycopy(distribution, 0, clone, 0, distribution.length);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly clone the input `distribution` array and return the cloned array. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
