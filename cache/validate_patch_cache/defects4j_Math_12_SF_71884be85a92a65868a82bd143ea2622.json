Given that the test is timing out for such a long time, it's possible that the function may have performance issues.\n\nWithout the original code and more context, it's difficult to determine the root cause. However, here are some general strategies to optimize the code:\n\n1. Consider evaluating if a more efficient data structure can replace an array or list.\n2. Look for unnecessary looping and see if it can be eliminated.\n3. If possible, evaluate if certain calculations can be pre-computed or cached to save time.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and context so I can better assist you.",
