Without knowing the code being referred to, I cannot provide a correct function to fix the bug you mentioned. \n\nRegarding the timeout error you're seeing, it's possible that the algorithm being used in the function is inefficient or there is an infinite loop that is causing the test to take too long to complete. Without further context or code to review, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
