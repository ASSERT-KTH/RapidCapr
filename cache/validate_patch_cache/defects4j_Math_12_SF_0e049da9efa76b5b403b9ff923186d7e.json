    "patch": "It sounds like there may be a performance issue with the code. Without seeing the code, I cannot determine the specific issue. However, I can provide some general advice on optimization:\n\n1. Use efficient data structures: Choosing the right data structure can significantly impact the performance of your code. For example, using a hash map instead of a list for looking up values can result in faster execution times.\n\n2. Minimize loop iterations: If possible, try to minimize the number of loop iterations by using early exit strategies or loop unrolling.\n\n3. Reduce function calls: Excessive function calls can impact performance. If possible, try to eliminate unnecessary function calls or inline small functions.\n\n4. Use parallelism: Consider using threads to run sections of code simultaneously if applicable.\n\nI hope these tips help. If you provide me with more specific details, I can try to provide a more targeted solution.",
