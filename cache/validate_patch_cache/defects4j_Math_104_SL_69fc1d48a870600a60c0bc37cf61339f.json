Since no code was provided, I mistakenly assumed that the infill location was a single line.\n\nRegarding the `error: class, interface, or enum expected` error, it is likely that the code is missing a closing brace for a class, interface, or enum declaration.\n\nWithout seeing the code, I cannot give a specific infill location. However, I recommend checking the syntax of the code and making sure that all opening braces have a corresponding closing brace.",
