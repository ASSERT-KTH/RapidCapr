    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Without further context, it is difficult to identify the cause of the compilation error you are facing. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach this issue.\n\nThe error message \"operand expected (error token is \"=\")\" usually indicates a syntax error in the code. You should carefully review the entire code and ensure that all syntax is correct and that all statements follow the correct syntax rules.\n\nOne common cause of this error is the use of an assignment operator (=) in a place where a comparison operator (e.g., ==) is expected. For example, if you have a conditional statement like `if (x = 2)` instead of `if (x == 2)`, you will get this error.\n\nAnother possible cause is that there is a missing parenthesis or a semicolon in the code.\n\nIf you are still having trouble resolving the issue, please provide more context and code samples so I can better understand the problem you are facing.",
