Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the line I suggested did not resolve the issue. \n\nWithout seeing the full code, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution, but it seems that a `{` or `}` might be missing in the code, or there might be a syntax error in one of the lines preceding the line where the error occurs. \n\nPlease provide me with the full stack trace of the compilation error, along with the location of the problematic file and line number, so I can assist you better.",
