    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and the specific test that is timing out, it's difficult to provide a complete solution. However, here are some possible fixes:\n\n1. Check if the test is running slower than expected due to some performance issues. You can try profiling the code to identify any bottlenecks and optimize them. Additionally, you can try running the test on a machine with more resources to see if it completes successfully.\n\n2. If the test is taking a long time to run due to external factors (such as network latency), you may try mocking the external dependencies or creating a test double to simulate the behavior of those dependencies.\n\n3. You can also try splitting the test into smaller, more focused tests. This can help isolate the issue and identify which part of the code is causing the timeout.\n\n4. If none of these solutions work, you may need to refactor the code to make it more efficient and avoid the timeout issue. You can also consider increasing the timeout value in the `@Test` annotation, although this is generally not recommended as it can mask underlying issues in the code.\n\nPlease let me know if none of these solutions work, and I can provide further assistance based on the specific code and test in question.",
