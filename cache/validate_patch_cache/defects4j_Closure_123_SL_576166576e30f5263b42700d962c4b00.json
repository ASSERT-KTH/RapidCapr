Based on the error you provided, there might be an issue with the structure of the code. \n\nWithout more context or information about the code, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, here are a few possible suggestions to fix the `illegal start of type` error:\n\n1. Check to make sure that all opening and closing braces `{}` are properly paired and nested.\n2. Check to make sure that any opening parentheses `(` are properly matched with closing parentheses `)` and that all parentheses are balanced.\n3. Make sure that any method or class declarations are properly closed with a closing brace `}`.\n4. Check the syntax of any statements preceding the error location to make sure there are no syntax errors or typos.\n\nIf you could provide me with more information, such as the full code snippet or the specific file name and line number where the error occurred, I may be able to offer more targeted advice and solutions.",
