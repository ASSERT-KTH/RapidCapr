    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working. Here's another implementation that should work correctly.\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[][] dp = new double[n][m + 1];\n    dp[0][0] = 1.0;\n    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                dp[(i + k) % n][j] += dp[i][j - 1] * distribution[k] / n;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return dp[0];\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses dynamic programming to compute the probability of having a certain number of balls in each box after `m` rounds. We represent the probability of having `i` balls in box `j` after `k` rounds by `dp[i][k][j]`. The final probability distribution is the probability of having a certain number of balls in box `0` after `m` rounds, i.e., `dp[0][m]`.\n\nWe can reduce the space complexity by using only the last two rounds of the probability distributions. So, we only need to store the probability of having `i` balls in each box at the end of `j` rounds, where `j` is either `m` or `m-1`. Hence, we can replace `dp[i][k][j]` with `dp[i][j]` and `dp[i][(j-1)%2]` (the probability distribution at the end of the previous round).\n\nI hope this implementation works for you. Please let me know if you have any further problems or concerns.",
