    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Since the code is not provided in the question, I cannot guarantee a fix for the timeout error. However, I can provide some general advice:\n\n- Make sure that there are no infinite loops in the code.\n- Try to improve the performance of the code by using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n- Ensure that the code is not relying on external resources that may be slow or unreliable.\n- Check if there are any synchronization issues in the multi-threaded code that may be causing the timeout error.\n\nIf the issue still persists, please provide the relevant code so that I can assist you further.",
