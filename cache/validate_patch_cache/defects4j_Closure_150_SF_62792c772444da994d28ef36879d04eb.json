Upgrade the compiler to the latest version and see if the issue persists.\n2. Check if the input code is correct and error-free. Sometimes internal compiler errors can occur due to incorrect input code.\n3. Check the input code for any recursive loops that may be causing the internal compiler error.\n4.
