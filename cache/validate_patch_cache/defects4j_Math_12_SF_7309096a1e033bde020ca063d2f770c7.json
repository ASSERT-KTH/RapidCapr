    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. Without seeing the original code, I can only provide a general solution.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out after 600 seconds. This could be due to inefficiencies in the code or a large amount of data being processed.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try optimizing the code and reducing the amount of data being processed. This may involve using more efficient algorithms, reducing the input size, or parallelizing the computation to distribute the workload across multiple processors.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution. However, I recommend profiling the code to identify areas of inefficiency and optimizing those areas to improve performance.",
