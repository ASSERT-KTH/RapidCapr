    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. Without code to work with, I cannot provide a pre-written function for you. However, I can give some general suggestions on how to address the timeout error.\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure your code doesn't contain any infinite loops, i.e., loops without a stopping condition.\n\n2. Optimize your code: If your code is running slower than expected, try to optimize it for better performance. For example, try to reduce the number of loops and conditionals, and make use of data structures that have fast lookup times.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value: Sometimes, the timeout error might be occurring because the test is taking longer than expected to run. You can try increasing the timeout value and see if that resolves the error.\n\nWithout knowing more about the specifics of your code, it's hard to provide more detailed advice. If you still need assistance, please provide the code and more information about the problem you are trying to solve.",
