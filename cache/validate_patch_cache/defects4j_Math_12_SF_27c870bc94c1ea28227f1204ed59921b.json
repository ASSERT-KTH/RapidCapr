    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function. However, a timeout error usually occurs when a function is taking too long to execute. Here are some ways to potentially solve this issue:\n- Check if there are any infinite loops or recursive functions that do not have a base case\n- Optimize any loops or nested loops to run faster\n- Use more efficient data structures or algorithms\n- Check for any unnecessary code that can be removed\n- If the code involves making external API calls, ensure that they are not taking too long and are properly handled\n\nWithout seeing the code or knowing the specific problem, it is difficult to suggest a more specific solution.",
