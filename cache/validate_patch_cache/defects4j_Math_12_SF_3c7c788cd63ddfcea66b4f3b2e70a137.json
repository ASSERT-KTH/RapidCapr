    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not resolving the issue. Without knowing the exact code and error messages, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. Here are some general suggestions to fix this issue:\n\n1. One possible reason for this issue is that the code is taking too long to execute and the test times out. To fix this, you can try to optimize the code. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures, avoiding nested loops, or using parallel processing if possible.\n\n2. Another possibility is that the test environment or infrastructure is causing the timeout. Check if there are any network or system issues that might be preventing the test from completing. It could also be a resource issue, such as insufficient memory or CPU. To resolve this, you can try increasing the resources allocated to the test, such as memory or CPU allocation.\n\n3. If the above solutions do not work, try splitting the test into smaller tests or breaking it down into smaller parts to isolate the issue. This will help narrow down the root cause of the problem and make it easier to fix.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide me with more details and the specific error/exception messages so that I can provide a more specific solution for your case.",
