    "patch": "I'm sorry that my previous solution didn't solve the issue. Without knowing the exact code and the specific error/exception messages, I cannot determine the root cause of the issue. However, here are a few things that you can try:\n\n1. Ensure that the code is optimized and there are no infinite loops or performance bottlenecks.\n2. Increase the timeout duration of the test case. This can be specified in the test annotation or configuration file, depending on the test framework in use.\n3. If the test involves network or I/O operations, ensure that there are no connectivity issues or network timeouts.\n4. Check if the test framework in use has any limitations or known issues with long-running tests and consider switching to another framework if necessary.\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide me with more details and the specific error/exception messages so that I can provide a more specific solution.",
