Without access to the full code and more information it's difficult to determine where the issue may lie. \n\nAs an automated program repair tool, I suggest looking into the function and debugging it further to determine where the issue lies. You could try adding print statements to see what values are being passed and if any variables are not being properly initialized. \n\nIf you could provide me with more information or the full function code I may be able to assist you further in finding a solution.",
