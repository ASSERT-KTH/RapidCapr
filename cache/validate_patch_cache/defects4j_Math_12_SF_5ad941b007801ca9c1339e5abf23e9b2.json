    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Without access to the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution, but here are some general steps you can take to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for areas where the code can be optimized, such as reducing unnecessary computations or using more efficient data structures. This can help reduce the total runtime of the function and avoid timeouts.\n\n2. Parallelize the code: If possible, consider parallelizing the code to take advantage of multiple processing cores. This can significantly improve the performance of the function.\n\n3. Split the function into smaller parts: If the function is too large or complex, consider splitting it into smaller sub-functions that can be optimized and tested independently.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit: If none of the above options work, try increasing the timeout limit for the test. However, this should only be done as a last resort.\n\nAgain, without access to the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. I recommend carefully analyzing the code and running the test in a debugger to identify the root cause of the issue. Once you've identified the issue, you can make the necessary changes to improve performance and avoid timeouts.",
