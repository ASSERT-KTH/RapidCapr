It seems that the test is taking longer than the allowed 600 seconds to complete.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try to optimize the code to make it run faster, or increase the timeout limit in the testing framework. However, without seeing the actual code and test cases, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. \n\nIf you could provide more information about the code and the test cases, I would be happy to help you further.",
