Make sure that you're not running an infinite loop or any other long-running operation in the code.\n2. Check if any external resources are being fetched and causing the delay.\n3. Consider optimizing the code for better performance, such as reducing the number of iterations or improving the algorithm's efficiency.\n4. If the timeout is caused by the testing environment, try increasing the timeout limit or using a different testing platform.\n\nWithout more information on the code and testing environment, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
