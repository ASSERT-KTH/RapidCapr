    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code and the test case that timed out, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general suggestions to address a timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Evaluate if there are any parts of the code that can be made more efficient. This could involve reducing the number of iterations, using a more efficient data structure, or minimizing the number of calculations.\n\n2. Implement parallel processing: For CPU-intensive tasks, implementing parallel processing can help speed up the execution of the code. This involves decomposing the task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently.\n\n3. Increase the resources: If the issue is with the hardware resources, such as memory or processing power, consider increasing the allocated resources for the program.\n\n4. Simplify the input: A large input can cause the program to take a long time to execute. You may want to reduce the size of the input to simplify the execution.\n\n5. Debug the code: Sometimes the code may contain an infinite loop or a logical error that causes it to take a long time to execute. You can use a debugger to identify these issues and make the necessary fixes.\n\nOnce you have identified the issue, you may want to re-run the test case to see if it now completes successfully.",
