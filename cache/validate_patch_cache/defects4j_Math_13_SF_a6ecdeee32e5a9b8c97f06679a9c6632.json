For example, to set the maximum heap size to 2 GB, run the program with the following command:\n\n```\njava -Xmx2g YourProgram\n```\n\nIf increasing the heap size is not enough to solve the issue, you may need to consider optimizing the algorithm or reducing the input size to avoid running out of memory.",
