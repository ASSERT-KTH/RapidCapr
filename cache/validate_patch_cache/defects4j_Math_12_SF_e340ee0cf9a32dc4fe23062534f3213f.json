    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not resolving the issue. Without the actual code and test cases, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips for handling test timeouts:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or recursive function calls. If a function is stuck in a loop or calling itself recursively without a base case, it can cause the test to hang forever.\n\n2. Review long-running operations. If the function performs long-running operations, such as reading from a large database or performing complex calculations, it may be worthwhile to break up these operations into smaller, discrete tasks that can be tested independently.\n\n3. Consider using parallelization. If the tests are taking a long time to run due to the sheer number of test cases, consider using parallelization to execute the tests concurrently.\n\n4. Use mock objects. If the function relies on external dependencies that may not be available during testing, using mock objects can help speed up the tests and isolate the function's behavior.\n\nIf providing the actual code and error messages, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
