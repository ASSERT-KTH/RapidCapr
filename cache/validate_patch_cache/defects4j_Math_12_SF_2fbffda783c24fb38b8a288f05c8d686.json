Unfortunately, without the code or additional context, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution that will resolve this issue. However, a generally applicable strategy is to examine the code for long-running or infinite loops. Additionally, you may want to consider profiling the code to identify any performance bottlenecks.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, please provide additional context and code so I can provide a more targeted solution.",
