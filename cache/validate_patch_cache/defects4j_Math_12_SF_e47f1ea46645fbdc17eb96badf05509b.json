    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without access to the code and specific error messages, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, there are several reasons why a test may timeout, such as infinite loops, slow I/O operations, or excessive computation. Here are some steps that can be taken to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or recursion: Make sure that the code does not contain an infinite loop or recursion that can cause the test to run indefinitely.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If the code contains computationally expensive operations, they may cause the test to run longer than expected. Consider optimizing the code to reduce its complexity or improve its performance.\n\n3. Increase the allowed timeout: Some tests may take longer to run due to their complexity or data size. Consider increasing the allowed timeout for the test to complete.\n\n4. Debug with logging: If the test is still failing, add logging statements to help identify where the test is stalling or where the bottleneck is occurring.\n\nI hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.",
