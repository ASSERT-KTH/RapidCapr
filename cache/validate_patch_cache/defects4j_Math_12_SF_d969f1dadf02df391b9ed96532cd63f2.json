    "patch": "If the test is timing out, it's possible that the implementation of the function is not efficient enough to handle the given input. Without seeing the function and input size, it's difficult to say for sure what the issue is. However, here are some general tips to improve the efficiency of a function:\n\n1. Check for redundant computations - this means making sure you're not computing the same result multiple times. Store intermediate results in variables and reuse them if possible.\n\n2. Use more efficient data structures - for example, if you need to search or remove elements from a collection, consider using a `HashSet` or `HashMap` instead of a `List`.\n\n3. Use appropriate algorithmic techniques - for example, if you need to search for an element in a collection, consider using binary search instead of linear search.\n\n4. Test your function with large input sizes - this might reveal performance issues that are not present with smaller inputs.\n\n5. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks - this can help you pinpoint exactly where the issue lies and which parts of the function need to be optimized.\n\n\nIn order to provide a more specific solution, I would need to see the code for the function and the input size it's being tested with.",
