    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like your test is taking too long to complete and is timing out after 600 seconds.\n\nHere are some general suggestions that may help:\n\n1. Review your code and look for any long-running loops or operations that could be causing the test to take too long. Try to optimize these sections if possible to improve performance.\n2. Check the configuration of your test environment and ensure that it has sufficient resources to run the test, such as CPU, memory, and storage.\n3. Consider splitting the test into multiple smaller tests, each testing a specific aspect of the code.\n4. Increase the timeout period for the test if possible.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error message you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
