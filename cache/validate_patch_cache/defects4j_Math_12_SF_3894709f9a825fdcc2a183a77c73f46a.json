Without access to the code that is causing the error, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Review your code for any infinite loops or long-running operations, and optimize as needed.\n2. Consider increasing the timeout value for the test case, if possible.\n3. Check that your code is not being locked or blocked by any external resources or dependencies.\n4. Try running the test on a different machine or environment to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
