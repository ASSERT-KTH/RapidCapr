Here is another attempt at resolving the issue:\n\nConsidering the error message \"error: illegal start of type\", it seems that the issue might not be with the `rhsContext` variable, but rather with another syntax issue in the code that is causing a compilation error.\n\nIn order to properly diagnose and fix the issue, I would need to see more of the source code or the complete error message. It is difficult to determine the exact cause of the error without context.\n\nCould you please provide me with more of the source code or the complete error message, so that I can better understand the issue and provide a more targeted fix?",
