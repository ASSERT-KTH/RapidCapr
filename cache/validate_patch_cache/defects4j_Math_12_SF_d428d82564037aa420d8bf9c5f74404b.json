    "patch": "Without seeing the entire codebase and more details about the test that's timing out, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips for addressing slow-running tests:\n\n1. Identify the bottleneck: Is the test waiting for network or I/O operations, interacting with a slow external system, or performing heavy computations? Once you have identified the bottleneck, you can come up with better strategies for testing that area of the code without relying on slow operations.\n\n2. Use mocks or stubs: If the test is interacting with a slow external system, you can use mocks or stubs to simulate the external system's behavior without actually making requests to it. This way, you can isolate the test from the slow external system and still validate that the code is working correctly.\n\n3. Optimize the test code: Review the code in the test method and see if there are any obvious areas where optimization could improve the test's runtime. For example, can you reduce the number of iterations in a loop, optimize any calculations, or remove redundant code?\n\n4. Split up the test into smaller tests: If a test is taking a long time to run, consider splitting it up into smaller, more focused tests. This can help you isolate any performance issues and make it easier to identify the source of the problem.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide more details about the test and the relevant code so that we can help identify the underlying problem.",
