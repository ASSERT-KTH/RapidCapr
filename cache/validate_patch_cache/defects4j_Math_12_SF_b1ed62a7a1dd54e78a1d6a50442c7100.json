    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the code, it's difficult for me to determine exactly what is causing the timeout. However, here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Optimize any loops or recursive functions in your code. Make sure that there are no unnecessary computations.\n\n2. Check for any infinite or redundant recursive calls.\n\n3. Use proper data structures to improve the performance of your code.\n\n4. Consider using parallelization to speed up the code.\n\n5. Try to identify the specific part of your code that is causing the timeout.\n\nIf you are still having trouble fixing the timeout issue, please provide me with the code and more information on the environment in which it is running so that I can help you better.",
