    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without actually seeing the code and the context of the test, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, a timeout error usually occurs when the function takes too much time to run, causing the test to exceed the maximum allowed time. Here are some general tips to improve code performance and avoid timeout errors:\n\n1. Avoid nested loops wherever possible as they tend to increase the execution time.\n2. Use efficient data structures and algorithms for complex operations like sorting and searching.\n3. Use parallel processing techniques for operations that can be performed concurrently.\n4. Avoid unnecessary object creation as it can slow down the program.\n5. Use caching mechanisms to avoid repeated calculations.\n\nYou can also try increasing the timeout limit of the test if it is appropriate in your context.",
