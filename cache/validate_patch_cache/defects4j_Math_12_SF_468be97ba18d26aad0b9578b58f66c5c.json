However, based on the information provided, it seems like the issue might be related to a performance problem rather than a logical error. \n\nThe fact that the test timed out after 600 seconds suggests that the function is taking longer than that to execute, which is likely due to an inefficient algorithm or a large dataset or input. \n\nIf possible, you could try optimizing the function or reducing the input size to see if that resolves the issue. Alternatively, you could provide more information about the code and the test cases to help me understand the problem better and provide a more specific solution.",
