Unfortunately, without additional information about the code or the error message, it's difficult for me to provide a specific fix.\n\nHowever, a test timing out after 600 seconds suggests there could be a performance issue with the code. You might want to consider profiling the code to identify any bottlenecks or areas that can be optimized.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to consider breaking the test into smaller, more focused tests to isolate the issue. It's possible that the issue with the test is an interaction with another test or a specific portion of the code.\n\nOnce you have more specific information about the problem, please let me know and I'll do my best to provide a tailored solution.",
