    "patch": "If the code is timing out, it may be due to an inefficient algorithm or a large input causing it to take a long time to execute. Without seeing the code or knowing the specifics of the problem, it is difficult to determine the exact issue and provide a solution. However, here are some general tips for improving performance and avoiding timeouts:\n\n1. Optimize your algorithms: Take a closer look at the algorithms you are using. There may be ways to simplify or optimize them to reduce their running time. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve the problem in an efficient manner.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary iterations: Check if there are any unnecessary iterations or calculations that can be avoided. In some cases, caching or memoization can help avoid unnecessary calculations.\n\n3. Avoid exponential time complexity: Avoid using algorithms with exponential time complexity (such as factorial or exponential functions) as they can quickly become impractical for large input sizes.\n\n4. Consider parallelization or concurrency: In some cases, parallelization or concurrency can be used to speed up the program's execution time.\n\n5. Test with smaller inputs: Test the function with small inputs that are representative of the large inputs, and make sure that the function can handle them efficiently before testing with larger inputs.\n\nIt is also worth noting that increasing the timeout limit is often not a good solution, as it may hide performance issues. It is better to fix the underlying performance problem than to simply extend the timeout.",
