Based on the provided information, it is difficult to identify the exact cause of the failure and provide an accurate solution without analyzing the code in more detail. Here are some suggestions for possible causes of the failure and potential solutions that you could consider:\n\n1. It is possible that the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine()` method is returning an unexpected value, causing the `jsdocParser.parse()` method to throw an exception. You could try debugging the code to see if the `result` variable is populated correctly and if any other factors may be causing the unexpected behavior.\n\n2. The error message \"Recorded bad position information\" indicates that there may be an issue with the position information in the code. It is possible that the `jsdocParser.parse()` method is not being called correctly or that the position information is not being set properly during the parsing process. You could try verifying that the position information is being set correctly and that all necessary methods are being called in the correct order.\n\n3. If neither of the above suggestions resolves the issue, you could try looking at the code surrounding the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method to see if there are any other issues that may be affecting the parsing process. You could also consider reviewing the test code to see if there are any other factors that may be causing the test failure.\n\nWithout access to the entire codebase and additional information about the test failure and the expected behavior, it is difficult to provide a definitive solution.",
