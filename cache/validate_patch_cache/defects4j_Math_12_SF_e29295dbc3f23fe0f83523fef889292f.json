    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error message indicates that the test is still taking too long to complete and is exceeding the timeout limit set in the `@Test` annotation. \n\nHere are a few options you can try to fix this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: You can try optimizing the code to make it run faster. Look for potential bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms that are causing the test to take so long to complete and try to address them.\n\n2. Increase the timeout limit: You can also increase the timeout limit in the `@Test` annotation to give the test more time to complete. Try increasing it to a higher value, such as 1200 seconds (20 minutes). However, keep in mind that this is not a permanent fix and may not always be feasible.\n\n3. Split the test into smaller tests: If the test is testing multiple functionalities, you can try splitting it into smaller tests to make them run faster. This could help identify which part of the code is causing the delay and address it accordingly.\n\nWithout seeing the actual code and the test itself, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you can provide more context or information about the code and the test, I can try to help you further.",
