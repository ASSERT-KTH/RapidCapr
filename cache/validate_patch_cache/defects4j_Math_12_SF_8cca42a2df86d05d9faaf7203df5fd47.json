    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. Based on the error message, it seems that the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out. This could be due to a number of reasons such as an infinite loop or a poorly optimized algorithm.\n\nWithout seeing the code and the context in which it is being executed, I am unable to provide a solution that is guaranteed to work. However, here are a few troubleshooting tips that you can try:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops in the code. If there are, make sure to break out of them properly.\n\n2. Check if there are any recursive functions that are not terminating properly. Make sure that the base case is being reached.\n\n3. If the code involves data structures and algorithms, make sure that they are optimized for the task at hand. Look for any places where the code may be performing unnecessary computations or comparisons.\n\n4. If the code relies on external resources such as network or database connections, make sure that they are properly configured and that the code is handling any errors that may arise.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. If you are still experiencing issues, I recommend consulting with a more experienced developer or seeking additional support resources.",
