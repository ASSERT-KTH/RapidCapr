    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code snippet or understanding the specific requirements, it is difficult to provide you with the correct function. \n\nHowever, I would suggest the following steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or recursive functions that are not terminating, which may result in the test timing out.\n2. Ensure that the test environment is properly set up, and any required dependencies are present.\n3. Check the time complexity of the algorithm and optimize it if required.\n4. If none of the above steps help, consider contacting the original code author or a senior developer for assistance.\n\nOnce the issue has been resolved, a correct function can be provided.",
