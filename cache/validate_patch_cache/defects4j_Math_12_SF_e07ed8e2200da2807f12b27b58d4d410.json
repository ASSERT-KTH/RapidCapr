    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that there is an inefficiency or infinite loop in the code somewhere. Without seeing the code, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the issue, but here are some general tips for debugging and fixing a code that is timing out:\n\n1. Use a debugger: Start by using a debugger to step through the code and see where it is getting stuck or taking too long. Look for long loops, recursive calls, or any other potential bottlenecks.\n\n2. Profile the code: Profiling tools can help identify which methods are using the most CPU time and where optimizations can be made. Consider using a profiler to identify any hotspots in the code.\n\n3. Optimize the algorithm: If the code is taking too long to run, consider optimizing the algorithm or data structures used. Look for ways to reduce the number of iterations, eliminate unnecessary computation, or simplify the problem.\n\n4. Use parallel processing: If the code is performing large calculations, consider using parallel processing to distribute the workload across multiple cores or nodes.\n\n5. Simplify the problem: If the above steps fail to resolve the issue, consider simplifying the problem or breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help identify any specific areas of the code that are problematic and need further attention.\n\nWithout seeing the code that is timing out, it is difficult to provide a specific solution, but hopefully, these tips can help guide the debugging process.",
