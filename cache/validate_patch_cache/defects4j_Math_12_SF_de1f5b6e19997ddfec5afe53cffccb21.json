    "patch": "I'm sorry for the previous solution not working as expected. Without knowing the code, I can suggest a few debugging techniques for you to try:\n\n1. Use logging statements to identify which lines of code are being executed before the test fails.\n2. Uncomment sections of code to isolate the problem and see if it is related to a specific section of code.\n3. Implement a \"divide and conquer\" approach to testing large sections of code. This can be done by selectively removing code from the test to see where the issue lies.\n\nAlternatively, consider breaking down the code into smaller, modular functions, which can be tested independently. This can help with identifying the root cause of the issue. \n\nAgain, I am sorry that I cannot provide a specific solution without knowing the code. If you provide me with more details and the specific error/exception messages, I can provide a more specific solution.",
