    "patch": "There are a few issues with the given code and test case, so it is difficult to provide a straightforward fix. However, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. The code relies on the `ref.getAssignedValue()` method to get the right-hand side of an assignment expression, but it assumes that this value is an object literal. This is not always the case, and there are many other possible types of values that might appear here. As a result, the code may fail or produce incorrect results for some inputs.\n\nOne possible fix would be to check the type of the assigned value and handle each case appropriately. For example, if the assigned value is an object literal, then the current code could be used to generate the new assignment statements. If the assigned value is not an object literal, then some other strategy could be employed.\n\n2. The code constructs a new AST node by hand using many calls to the `Node` constructor. This can be error-prone and difficult to read or modify.\n\nOne possible fix would be to use a code transformation library such as `Google Closure Compiler` which provides classes and methods for working with AST nodes in a more abstract and convenient way. This would make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\n3. The given test case includes various placeholders like `LOCAL_PREFIX`, `LOCAL_POSTFIX`, and `code` that are not defined in the provided code or context. This makes it impossible to understand or reproduce the test case.\n\nOne possible fix would be to provide a complete and self-contained test case that includes all necessary input data, expected output, and context. This would allow the bug to be reproduced and tested more easily, and it would also make it easier to understand what the code is supposed to do.",
