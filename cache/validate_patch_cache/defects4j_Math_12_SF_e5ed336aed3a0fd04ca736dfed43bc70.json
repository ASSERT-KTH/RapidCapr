    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Without seeing the full code, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution to fix the timeout error.\n\nA \"Test timed out after 600 seconds\" error message generally indicates that the test is taking too long to execute, and the test framework has timed it out after a set limit of 600 seconds (10 minutes). This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an infinite loop or a poorly optimized algorithm.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the test case that is timing out. It is usually mentioned in the error message.\n2. Look for any loops or recursive calls in the code that could cause it to run indefinitely.\n3. Consider optimizing the code to improve its performance. You can try changing the algorithm or using data structures that are more efficient.\n4. Increase the timeout limit of the test if it is necessary and reasonable to do so.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details or information on the code and the error message, I would be glad to provide more specific suggestions on how to fix the issue.",
