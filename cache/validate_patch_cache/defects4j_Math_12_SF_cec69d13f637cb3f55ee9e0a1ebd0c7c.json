    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. In this case, it would be difficult to provide a correct function without being able to reproduce and debug the issue myself. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is taking too long to execute and is timing out after 600 seconds. \n\nThere are several strategies that can be used to fix a test that times out, such as:\n\n1. Simplify the test: Break the test down into smaller parts or reduce the amount of data being used to make the test simpler and faster.\n2. Mock dependencies: Use mocking frameworks or fake objects to simulate the behavior of external dependencies and make the test faster.\n3. Optimize the code: Refactor the code being tested to make it more efficient and reduce the time it takes to execute.\n4. Increase the timeout: If there is no other way to fix the test, you can increase the timeout period to give the test more time to run.\n\nHowever, without more context and information about the specific code and test case, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.",
