Given the limited information and the fact that the code has a timeout error, it could be that the current implementation has performance issues, or that the bug still exists.\n\nI recommend optimizing the code to avoid timeouts or trying to increase the timeout duration if possible. Additionally, it would be best to identify the exact line of code where the timeout occurs to determine the potential issue.\n\nIf you can provide more information or the complete code with error details, I would be happy to help with a more specific solution.",
