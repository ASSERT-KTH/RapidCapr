This could involve using a concrete class or a type that is already mocked or implemented, rather than a generic class.\n\nIf that is not possible, another approach could be to use a specialized mocking library that is better equipped to handle the complexities of generic classes.\n\nI realize this may not be the solution you were hoping for, but I hope it provides some direction and context for the issue at hand. Thank you for your patience and understanding.",
