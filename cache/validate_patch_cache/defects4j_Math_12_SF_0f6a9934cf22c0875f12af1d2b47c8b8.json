    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the fix I provided is not sufficient to fully address the issue. Without seeing the complete code and understanding the problem in depth, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate and complete solution.\n\nTo address the issue of the test timing out, it is possible that the algorithm for the function is too inefficient and is taking an excessive amount of time to complete. One possible solution would be to examine the algorithm and optimize its time complexity.\n\nAlternatively, it may be possible to reconfigure the test environment to allow for longer execution times, if this is deemed appropriate. However, this may not be an ideal solution as it could result in longer wait times for other tests and impact the overall efficiency of the testing process.\n\nIf you could provide me with the complete code and additional information about the problem, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide more targeted solutions.",
