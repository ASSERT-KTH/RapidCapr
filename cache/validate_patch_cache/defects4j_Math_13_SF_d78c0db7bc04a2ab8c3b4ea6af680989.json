However, here are some general suggestions for addressing the issues:\n\n1. In the `multiply` method, the condition `x >= 0 && x < RADIX` suggests that the `multiplyFast` method is only valid for a limited range of input values. If this is the case, then the code may need to be updated to handle input values outside of that range differently. Alternatively, if the `multiplyFast` method should be valid for all input values, then there may be a bug in that method that needs to be fixed.\n2. In the `squareRoot` method, the `OutOfMemoryError` suggests that the matrix being passed to the `EigenDecomposition` constructor may be too large for the available memory. If this is the case, then the matrix may need to be processed in smaller chunks or a different algorithm may need to be used. Alternatively, if the matrix size should be reasonable but the `EigenDecomposition` constructor is still causing memory issues, then there may be a bug in that method that needs to be fixed.",
