    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some changes that might help to fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops in the code. If there are any, break out of the loop at the appropriate time.\n\n2. Try to optimize the code to decrease the overall runtime. This can involve removing any unnecessary computations or loops.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value of the test as appropriate. This will give the code more time to execute before the test fails.\n\n4. Use multi-threading if possible to speed up the execution of the code.\n\n5. If possible, parallelize any loops or computations to improve performance.\n\nIf none of these suggestions work, it may be necessary to analyze the code more closely to identify the root cause of the issue.",
