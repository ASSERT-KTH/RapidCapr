    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Unfortunately, without seeing the code and details of the test case that is timing out, it is difficult for me to provide a solution. It could be due to the complexity of the algorithm or some other issue. \n\nHowever, you can try the following suggestions to fix the issue:\n\n1. Reduce the size of the input data for the test case that is timing out. This could help in identifying any issues with the code.\n\n2. Add some debugging statements to the code to identify the portion of the code that is taking too much time.\n\n3. Optimize the algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n\n4. Check if the test case is written correctly and not causing any infinite loops or other issues.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details about the code and test cases, I might be able to provide more specific suggestions.",
