    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake. Since the line I suggested did not resolve the compilation error, there may be another issue with the code. \n\nBased on the error message, it seems like there's a syntax error in the code. It's possible that there's an open curly brace without a corresponding close curly brace somewhere in the code, or there's a similar issue with parentheses. \n\nWithout seeing the full code, it's difficult for me to determine exactly where the issue is. However, to fix the error, you can try checking the syntax of your code carefully, and ensure that all opening brackets are matched with corresponding closing brackets. \n\nOnce you've resolved the syntax error(s), if the compilation error persists, please feel free to reach out to me again. I'd be happy to provide further assistance.",
