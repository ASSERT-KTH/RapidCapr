    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous attempts were not successful. It is difficult to fix this issue without seeing the code implementation and test cases. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is timing out after 600 seconds, which means that the function is taking too long to execute.\n\nTo address the timeout issue, you can try optimizing the algorithm used in the function to reduce its computational complexity. Here are some general tips to optimize an algorithm:\n\n1. Identify the bottleneck: Identify the part of the code that is taking the most time to execute. This will likely be the most complex part of the algorithm.\n\n2. Simplify the algorithm: Simplify the algorithm as much as possible to reduce its computational complexity. This may involve changing the data structures used, reducing the number of loops, or eliminating unnecessary calculations.\n\n3. Use efficient data structures: Use data structures that are efficient for the task at hand. For example, if you need to search for elements in a collection, use a hash table instead of a list.\n\n4. Use efficient algorithms: Use algorithms that are efficient for the task at hand. For example, if you need to sort a large dataset, use a quicksort instead of a bubblesort.\n\nWithout more information about the implementation and test cases, it is hard to give a more specific answer. If you can provide more details, I can try to help you further.",
