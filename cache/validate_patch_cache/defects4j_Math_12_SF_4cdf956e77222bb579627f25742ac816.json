    "patch": "I apologize for the inaccuracy in my previous response. It seems that the issue is not fixed yet. To address the timeout error, it may be possible to optimize the implementation further.\n\nWithout seeing the code or understanding its complexity, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to optimize the code:\n\n1. Check for any unnecessary computations or loops that can be removed.\n2. Optimize for the specific hardware and software environment where the function is executed.\n3. Reduce the size of any data structures used in the function.\n4. Utilize parallel processing where possible to take full advantage of available hardware.\n5. Cache and precompute any values that are used more than once.\n\nI hope this helps in optimizing the code. If you could provide me with more information or the exact code, I may be able to provide more specific guidance.",
