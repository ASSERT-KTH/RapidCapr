    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. Without the specific code snippet, it's difficult to provide the exact hunk to fix the issue. \n\nHowever, the error message you're seeing suggests that there is a problem with an equals sign (=) being used where it shouldn't be. Most commonly, this error occurs when you're trying to assign a value to a variable within a conditional statement, rather than comparing two values.\n\nPlease double-check any instances where you're using a conditional statement, such as an if statement or a while loop, and ensure that you're using a comparison operator (==) rather than an assignment operator (=) where appropriate.\n\nIf you're still having issues, please provide the relevant code snippet where the error is occurring so that I can assist you further.",
