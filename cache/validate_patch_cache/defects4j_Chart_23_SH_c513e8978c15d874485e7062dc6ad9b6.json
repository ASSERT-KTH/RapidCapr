    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not work. Without seeing the context of the code and the definition of `r1` and `r2`, I cannot provide a specific hunk to fix the issue. \n\nHowever, the compilation error you mentioned suggests that there might be a syntax error elsewhere in the code, possibly on a line before or after the assertion that we were trying to fix. Here are some possible general fixes to consider:\n\n- Make sure all necessary imports have been included.\n- Check for any missing or extra parentheses or semicolons on the lines before or after the assertion.\n- Verify that the variables being used in the assertion have been declared and initialized correctly. \n- Double check that the syntax of the assertion itself (`assertFalse`, `assertEquals`, etc.) is correct.\n\nI hope this helps! If none of these suggestions fix the issue, please provide more context and code for me to work with.",
