Without further information or access to the code, I am unable to provide a correct function that would solve the issue in the previously mentioned test. \n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is timing out. This could be due to a long-running calculation or an infinite loop in your function. I suggest debugging the code or posting the code so that I can take a closer look and provide suggestions on how to fix the issue.",
