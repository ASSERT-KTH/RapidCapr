Without seeing the actual code, it's difficult for me to provide a correct function. \n\nHowever, a timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute. It could be that the function is inefficient or there's some kind of infinite loop or recursion happening.\n\nI suggest looking at the function and profiling it to see where the bottleneck is. It could also be helpful to look at any error logs that might have been generated during the test.",
