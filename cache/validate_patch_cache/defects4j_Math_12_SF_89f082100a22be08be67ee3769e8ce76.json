Without access to the code or the test suite causing the error, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, one possible solution to the timeout issue is to optimize the code by removing any redundant loops or operations. Additionally, you can try running the test suite on a faster machine with better computational resources to see if that helps.\n\nIf you can provide more information on the code and the test suite, I can provide a more specific solution.",
