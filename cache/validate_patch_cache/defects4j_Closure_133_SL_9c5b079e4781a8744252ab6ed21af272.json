Based on the information provided, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact fix for the issue. \n\nHere are a few suggestions that you can try to fix the issue:\n\n1. Check if the `stream` variable is not null before calling `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method. If it is null, return an empty string or throw an exception as per the requirement.\n\n2. Debug the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine()` method to see if it is returning the expected string.\n\n3. Make sure that the `jsdocParser.parse()` method is being called correctly, with the correct arguments, and that it is not causing any issues.\n\nI hope these suggestions help in resolving the issue. If you provide more information about the code and the test cases, I may be able to provide more specific guidance.",
