    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without the code and test suite, it is difficult for me to provide the exact solution. However, I can give you a general suggestion to fix the timeout error.\n\nOne common reason for a test timeout error is that the function is taking too long to execute. You can try to optimize the code by identifying any loops or recursive functions that are taking too long to execute and make them more efficient.\n\nAdditionally, you can increase the timeout setting for the test by modifying the configuration file or annotating the test class or method with a @Timeout annotation. \n\nIn general, it is important to make sure that the function is optimized and running efficiently to prevent timeout errors.",
