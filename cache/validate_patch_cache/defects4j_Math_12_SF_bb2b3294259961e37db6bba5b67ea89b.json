Without access to the full code base, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue.\n\nIn this case, I suggest considering the following steps to debug and solve the issue:\n\n1. Check if any infinite loops are present in the code.\n2. Use a debugger to step through the code and see where it's taking too long.\n3. Check if the input data to the function is valid and within expected ranges.\n4. Consider optimizing the code, if possible, to reduce the execution time.\n\nIf you could provide me with the full implementation of the function, I may be able to help you in a more targeted manner.",
