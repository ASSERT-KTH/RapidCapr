    "patch": "Unfortunately, it's difficult to provide a solution without knowing the details of the code and the specific requirements. However, here are a few general tips on how to handle a timeout error:\n\n1. Check your algorithm: It's possible that your algorithm might be inefficient, especially with larger inputs. Check whether there's a more optimal algorithm or solution that could handle the inputs more efficiently.\n\n2. Optimize your code: Look for any parts of your code that might be causing performance issues. For example, you might have a loop that's running too many times, or some code that's taking longer than it should. Try to optimize those parts of the code to make the program faster.\n\n3. Increase the timeout: If you're running tests in an online testing platform like CodeSignal, you might be able to increase the timeout time. Try increasing the timeout time to see if that solves the issue.\n\n4. Divide the problem into smaller tasks: If the problem is too complex or large, try breaking it down into smaller tasks. Solve each subtask one at a time and combine them to solve the overall problem. That way, you can avoid lengthy computations and reduce the memory usage.\n\nWithout more specific information, it's hard to provide a more detailed solution.",
