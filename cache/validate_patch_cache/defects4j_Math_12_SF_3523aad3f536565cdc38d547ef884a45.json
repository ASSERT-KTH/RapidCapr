Without the initial code or more information about the problem, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, I can suggest the following steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or recursive calls in the code\n2. Check if there are any missing or incorrect dependencies in the project\n3. Check if there are any input data that might cause the code to run slowly or infinitely\n4. Split the test into smaller, more focused tests to isolate the problem\n5. Increase the timeout limit for the test if appropriate.\n\nOnce you've tried these steps and identified the root cause of the problem, you can work on implementing a solution.",
