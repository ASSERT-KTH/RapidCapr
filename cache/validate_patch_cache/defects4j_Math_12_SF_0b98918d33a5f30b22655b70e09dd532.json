    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not solve the issue. Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult for me to determine the root cause of the issue and provide a fix.\n\nHowever, the fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there might be a performance issue in the code. It's possible that the function is taking too long to execute and is causing the test to time out.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try optimizing the function to improve its performance. This could involve identifying any computationally expensive operations and finding more efficient ways of executing them.\n\nAlternatively, you can try increasing the timeout duration for the test to give the function more time to execute. However, this is not a recommended solution as it might only mask the underlying performance issue without actually resolving it.\n\nIf you provide me with more information about the code and the specific test that's timing out, I might be able to provide more specific advice on how to fix the issue.",
