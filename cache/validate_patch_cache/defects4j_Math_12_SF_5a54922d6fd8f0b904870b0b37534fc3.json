    "patch": "I apologize for the previously suggested solutions that did not work. Based on the compilation error you're encountering, it seems like the issue is not with the implementation of the `normalize` function itself, but with the test method.\n\nIf you're still facing a timeout issue, one possible reason could be that the `normalize` function is taking too long to execute, especially if the size of the input array is very large. \n\nHere is an alternative implementation of the `normalize` function that uses primitive array operations instead of streams. This implementation should be more performant and may help in resolving the timeout issue:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        sum += distribution[i];\n    }\n\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return new double[distribution.length];\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n    }\n\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation is functionally equivalent to the previous implementation that used streams. The only difference is that it uses a standard for-loop instead of a stream to calculate the sum of the elements in the input array, and then another for-loop to normalize each element and store the results in a new double array. \n\nIf you're still encountering the same timeout issue after trying this implementation, there may be other factors at play that require further investigation. If that is the case, please provide more details about the test method and the input values being used.",
