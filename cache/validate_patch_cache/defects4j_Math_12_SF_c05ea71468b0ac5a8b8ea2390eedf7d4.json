    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some changes that might help to fix the timeout error.\n\nFirstly, make sure that the code is not running any unnecessary computations or loops that could cause the test to time out. It's important to ensure that the code is only handling the necessary input parameters and returning the correct output values.\n\nSecondly, try to optimize any algorithms or calculations being used in the code to reduce the time complexity. This could involve using more efficient data structures, eliminating redundant calculations, or implementing caching or memoization techniques.\n\nLastly, you could try increasing the timeout value of the test, if possible. This will give the code more time to execute before the test fails. However, increasing the timeout should be done only as a last resort, as it can mask underlying issues in the code.\n\nIf the issue persists, it may be necessary to perform more in-depth analysis of the code to identify the root cause of the timeout error.",
