    "patch": "Without being able to see the code in question or the specific test case, it is difficult to provide a solution that will definitely work. However, if the code is running fine and the error appears to be a timeout issue, there are a few things that could be causing the problem:\n\n1. The test case may simply be taking too long to run. In this case, the timeout may need to be increased to allow the test case to complete successfully.\n2. There may be an infinite loop or other form of recursion in the code, causing it to run indefinitely. In this case, the code will need to be debugged and fixed accordingly.\n3. There may be threading issues in the code, causing the test case to hang indefinitely. Again, the code will need to be debugged and fixed accordingly.\n\nHere are a few general suggestions for how to address the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check the logs and error messages to see if there are any clues as to what is causing the timeout. This may provide insight into what needs to be fixed.\n2. Increase the timeout value for the test case. This could allow the test case to complete successfully, but it may not be a permanent solution.\n3. Debug the code and see if you can identify any issues that may be causing it to hang indefinitely. This could be a long and difficult process, but it is often the only way to definitively fix the issue.\n4. Consider using a profiling tool to identify performance bottlenecks in the code. This could help you optimize the code and make it run faster, thereby avoiding the timeout issue altogether. \n\nUntil you provide more details on the code and the test that is failing, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution than this.",
