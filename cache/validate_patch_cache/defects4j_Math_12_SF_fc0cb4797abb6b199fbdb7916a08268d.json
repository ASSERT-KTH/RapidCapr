    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fixes not resolving the issue. It seems that the function is taking too long to execute and the test is timing out after 600 seconds.\n\nWithout access to the code or more information about the requirements, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message, there are a few possible ways to fix this issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Try to make the code more efficient. Review the algorithms being used and refactor if necessary. Consider using caching, memoization, or other techniques to reduce computation.\n\n2. Limit the input: If the input to the function is large, then it may help to limit the input data. For example, if the function is processing a large file, try processing a smaller portion of the file.\n\n3. Use parallel processing: If the computation being performed is very complex, it may be possible to split it into smaller parts and run them in parallel. This can help reduce the overall execution time.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above options work, you might consider increasing the timeout limit to give the function more time to execute.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend a specific solution without more information about the code and requirements. I suggest profiling the code to identify any bottlenecks and then tuning it accordingly.",
