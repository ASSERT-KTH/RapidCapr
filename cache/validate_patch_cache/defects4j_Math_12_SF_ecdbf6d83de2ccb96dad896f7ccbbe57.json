    "patch": "I apologize for not properly addressing the issue in my previous response. The `Test timed out` error suggests that the code is taking an excessively long time to execute. \n\nWithout access to the relevant code, I cannot provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips to optimize code that is taking too long to run:\n\n1. Analyze the code to identify any inefficient algorithms or data structures.\n2. Reduce or eliminate unnecessary computations or conditionals.\n3. Optimize loops and minimize nested loops.\n4. Reduce the complexity of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n5. Use built-in functions or libraries where possible to save computation time.\n6. Implement parallelism or multithreading to make the most of available computing resources.\n7. Minimize the use of disk or network I/O, as these are typically slower operations than in-memory computations.\n\nIf you can provide me with the relevant code and more details about the problem, I would be happy to try and help optimize it.",
