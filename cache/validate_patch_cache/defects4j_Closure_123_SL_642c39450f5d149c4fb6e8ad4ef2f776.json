    "patch": "Without seeing the surrounding code, it's hard to determine the exact fix needed. However, one possible fix for the \"illegal start of type\" error is to make sure the line of code is inside a method or a constructor, and that it is not defining a new class or interface. For example, if the line `Context rhsContext = Context.OTHER;` was originally at the top level of a class, it would cause this error. Moving it into a method or constructor should fix the issue.\n\nIf you provide more information about the surrounding code, I can provide a more specific fix for the error.",
