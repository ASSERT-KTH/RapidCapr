    "patch": "Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine why the function might be timing out. Here are a few general tips that could be useful for fixing the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize any loops that are running slow. Consider whether you can reduce the number of iterations or if you can use a more efficient algorithm.\n\n2. Check for any nested loops that could be causing the timeout. If you can eliminate any nested loops or optimize them, the function may run faster.\n\n3. If your program is doing any IO, make sure that it is buffered properly. Unbuffered IO can be significantly slower, often causing timeouts.\n\n4. Try running the function in a profiler to see where the bottleneck is. This should help you identify where you need to focus your optimization efforts.",
