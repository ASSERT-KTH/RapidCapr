    "patch": "Unfortunately, I cannot provide a correct function without more information about the original code and the underlying problem.\n\nHowever, the fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there may be a performance issue in the code. It is possible that the function is taking too long to complete or is running an infinite loop.\n\nTo address this, you may need to analyze the code further to identify potential bottlenecks or optimize the algorithm to improve its performance. You could also consider parallelizing the code or breaking it up into smaller, more manageable pieces to make it more efficient. \n\nIf you are still having trouble resolving the issue, please provide me with more information or code samples to help identify the problem.",
