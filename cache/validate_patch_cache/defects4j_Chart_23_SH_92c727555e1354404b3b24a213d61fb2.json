    "patch": "Based on the compilation error, it seems like there might be a syntax error in the fixed version of the code. Without seeing the full code and the context of the error, it is difficult to provide a specific fix.\n\nHowever, a general suggestion would be to look at the line of code immediately before the infilled line and make sure that it is properly terminated with a semicolon `;`. If that line is not properly terminated, it can cause a compilation error on the following line. Alternatively, check the syntax of the code on the infilled line and ensure that there are no syntax errors such as missing parentheses or brackets.\n\nOnce you've identified the syntax error, you can provide a fix by correcting the syntax error in the infilled line.",
