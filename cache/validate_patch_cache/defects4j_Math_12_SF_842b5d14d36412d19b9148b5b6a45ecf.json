    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for bringing this to my attention. To fix the compilation error, I suggest the following updated solution:\n\n```\npublic static double[][] DistributionClone(double[][] original) {\n    if(original == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input cannot be null\");\n    }\n\n    int rows = original.length;\n    int cols = original[0].length;\n\n    double[][] result = new double[rows][cols];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {\n        System.arraycopy(original[i], 0, result[i], 0, cols);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nThis version includes a check to ensure that the input is not null and a new array is created to store the copy instead of changing the original array. This should prevent any side effects that could have caused the original timeout error.\n\nAgain, I apologize for any inconvenience and I hope this solution resolves the issue.",
