    "patch": "I apologize for the previous failed attempts. Without seeing the code, I can only make an assumption that the timeout could be caused by an infinite loop or the function is taking an extremely long time to execute.\n\nHowever, I can give you a general guideline to follow so that you can try to fix the code yourself. You can follow these steps to find and correct the bug:\n\n1. Reproduce the error \u2013 create unit tests that reproduce the problem or identify when the bug occurs.\n\n2. Identify the root cause \u2013 using the reports from the test results, examine the output to see the error message and the test assertions that failed.\n\n3. Debug the code \u2013 Use a debugger to step through the code and find the exact point where the error occurs.\n\n4. Fix the code \u2013 Once you have identified the root cause of the problem, develop the necessary changes to fix the code.\n\n5. Test the code \u2013 Once you have made changes to the code, ensure that the test cases now pass successfully and there are no regressions.\n\nI hope this helps you fix the code. Let me know if you require any further assistance.",
