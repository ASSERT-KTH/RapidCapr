    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake. It seems that the fix I provided did not resolve the issue. Without additional information, it is difficult to pinpoint the root of the problem and provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, a test timing out after 600 seconds indicates a performance issue with the code. It is possible that the algorithm being used is not efficient enough for the input sizes being tested.\n\nTo address this, you may consider performing a profiler analysis to identify the particular section of the code that is taking too long to execute. Once you have identified the bottleneck, you may apply optimization techniques to improve the performance.\n\nAlternatively, you may revise the tests to use smaller input sizes, or use a less computationally expensive algorithm for larger input sizes.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused and hope this helps in resolving the issue.",
