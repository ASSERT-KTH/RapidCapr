    "patch": "I apologize for the issues with the previous solutions. Without the exact code and test cases, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution that addresses this specific error message. Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:\n\n1. Check if there are any infinite loops or performance bottlenecks in the code. This can cause tests to take longer than expected and ultimately result in a timeout error.\n2. Try increasing the timeout limit for the test. This can be done in the test configuration or annotations, depending on the testing framework in use.\n3. Review the environment where the tests are running. If it is running on virtual or shared infrastructure, it's possible that the environment resources are constrained and thus causing the timeout. Consider upgrading the resources or running the tests on a dedicated server or infrastructure.\n4. Try to isolate the specific test case that is causing the timeout and inspect the specific functionality being tested. It may be helpful to add additional logging or debug statements to help identify the issue.\n\nIf you can provide more details regarding the code and the test cases, I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
