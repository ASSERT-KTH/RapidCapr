Without seeing the actual code, it's hard for me to determine the root cause of the timeout error. \n\nIn general, a test timing out after 600 seconds means that the code is taking too long to execute, which could be due to a heavy computation or an infinite loop.\n\nIf you could provide me with the relevant code snippet, I would be happy to diagnose and fix the issue.",
