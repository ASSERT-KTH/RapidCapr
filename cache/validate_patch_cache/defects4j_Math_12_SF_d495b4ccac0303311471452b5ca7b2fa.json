    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems like the function is taking longer than expected or getting stuck somewhere. To provide a correct function, I would need to see the complete code and understand the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. However, here are some general tips to help improve the performance of the function:\n\n1. Check for redundant calculations - If there are any calculations that are being repeated multiple times in the function, it may be helpful to store the result in a variable and reuse it later.\n\n2. Optimize loops - If the function has any loops, make sure the condition to terminate the loop is efficient. Additionally, if there are any nested loops in the function, try to reduce the number of iterations.\n\n3. Use efficient data structures - If the function uses data structures such as arrays or lists, make sure to choose the appropriate data structure that provides the best performance for the particular use case.\n\n4. Profile the function - It may be helpful to use a profiling tool to identify the bottleneck in the function. This can help to optimize the performance of the function by targeting the specific area causing the issue.\n\nIt may be necessary to make multiple iterations to optimize the function for better performance.",
