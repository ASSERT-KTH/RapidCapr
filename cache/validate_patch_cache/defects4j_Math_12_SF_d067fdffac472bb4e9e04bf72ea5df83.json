    "patch": "If the code is timing out, it may indicate that there is an infinite loop or inefficient algorithm in the code. Without access to the full codebase, it is difficult to determine the exact issue causing the timeout error. However, here are some general tips for optimizing code to avoid timeouts:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure your code does not contain any infinite loops that may cause the program to run indefinitely.\n\n2. Optimize algorithms: Make sure your code uses efficient algorithms and data structures to avoid slowing down the program. This may include using caching, memoization, or other techniques to avoid recomputing expensive operations.\n\n3. Review performance metrics: Use performance profiling tools to identify the parts of your code that are taking the most time and work to optimize those parts first.\n\n4. Break up tasks: If your code needs to perform a large number of tasks, consider breaking them up into smaller chunks to avoid overloading the program. Also, consider using parallel processing to take advantage of multicore processors.\n\n5. Avoid unnecessary computations: Make sure you are only performing computations that are necessary and avoid redundant or unnecessary ones.\n\nThese are some general tips that can help optimize code and avoid timeouts. However, without access to the full codebase and more context on the issue, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.",
