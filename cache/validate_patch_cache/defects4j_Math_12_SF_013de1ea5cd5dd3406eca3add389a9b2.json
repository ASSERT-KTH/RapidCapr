    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions still not working. Without the code and test suite causing the error it's difficult to provide a complete solution. However, I suggest trying to optimize the code or the test suite to reduce the runtime. If the tests are timing out after 600 seconds, it's possible that there is an issue with the performance of either the code or the tests themselves. \n\nHere are a few tips to optimize the code and/or test suite:\n\n1. Try reducing the input size of the tests to see if that helps.\n2. Use more efficient algorithms or data structures to perform computations within the code.\n3. Parallelize the tests if possible to run them concurrently.\n\nIf these solutions do not work, please provide more information so that I can give a more informed solution.",
