However, based on the test error you provided, it seems that there may still be an issue with the function's implementation.\n\nI would suggest trying to debug the code and identify any logical errors that could be causing the incorrect output. Additionally, you can also try increasing the timeout limit to give the function more time to execute. If the issue persists, please provide more information such as the code and test suite causing the error to occur so that I can provide a more accurate solution.",
