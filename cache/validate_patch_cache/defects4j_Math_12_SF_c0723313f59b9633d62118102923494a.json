    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. Without the code that is causing the test to time out, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, there are a few general strategies that can be used to optimize code that is causing timeouts:\n\n1. Use more efficient algorithms. Consider if there is a more efficient way to solve the problem.\n2. Reduce the input size. If the algorithm is correct but just slow, try reducing the input size in order to reduce the running time.\n3. Cache intermediate results. If computations are being repeated multiple times, consider caching intermediate results to avoid unnecessary computations.\n4. Use parallelization. If the algorithm is inherently parallelizable, consider using parallelization to speed up the computations. \n\nI hope this helps!",
