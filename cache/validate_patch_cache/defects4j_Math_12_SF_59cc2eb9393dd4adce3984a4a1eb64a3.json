    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not resolving the issue. It seems that the function is still not optimized enough to pass all the tests in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nWithout additional context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some potential strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider breaking the function into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n2. Use caching, memoization, or memoized recursion to avoid repeatedly computing values.\n3. Use dynamic programming to optimize the computation of the value.\n4. Use multi-threading to run the function in parallel, if possible.\n\nAs a last resort, you can consider changing the design of your algorithm or using a different approach to solve the problem.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and context so I can better assist you.",
