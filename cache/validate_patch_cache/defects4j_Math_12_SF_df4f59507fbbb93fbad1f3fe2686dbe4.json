However, it avoids computing the power of `1-p[j]` for each `i` by computing it only when necessary inside the inner loop. This reduces the total number of computations from O(n^2) to O(n), enabling the function to run correctly for larger values of `n`.\n\nThe last block of code handles the case when `n > p.length`, by adding the probabilities of the remaining clones to the last probability computed in the loop. This ensures that the function returns the correct distribution of probabilities for all values of `n`.\n\nI hope this solution meets your requirements and passes all tests.",
