    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that did not work for you. Please try the following optimized implementation of the function:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = 0.0d;\n    double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n    for (double d : distribution) {\n        sum += d;\n        if (d < min) {\n            min = d;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (sum == 0.0d) {\n        double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n        Arrays.fill(normalized, 1.0d / distribution.length);\n        return normalized;\n    }\n\n    double[] normalized = new double[distribution.length];\n    double factor = 1.0 / (sum - min * distribution.length);\n    for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        normalized[i] = (distribution[i] - min) * factor;\n    }\n\n    return normalized;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation calculates the sum of the elements in the input array element by element, and also keeps track of the minimum element in the array. If the sum is equal to zero, then the function initializes a normalized array with equal values of `1/distribution.length`. Otherwise, it calculates the factor for normalization as 1 divided by the difference between the sum of elements in the array and the product of the minimum element and the length of the array, and then uses it to normalize the distribution.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
