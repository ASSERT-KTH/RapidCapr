    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous solution did not work. It's possible that the issue is related to performance and the timeout error is being thrown due to a long-running loop or an inefficient algorithm.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult for me to determine the root cause of the timeout error, but I can suggest a few general strategies to improve the performance of your code:\n\n1. Optimize loops: Look for ways to reduce the number of iterations in loops, or eliminate them altogether if possible.\n\n2. Reduce function calls: Minimize the number of function calls and try to avoid calling functions in a loop.\n\n3. Eliminate unnecessary code: Remove any extraneous code that is not contributing to the end result.\n\n4. Use efficient data structures: Optimize the use of arrays, lists, and other data structures to make the most efficient use of memory.\n\nIf you are still having difficulty resolving the issue, please provide me with the code, and I will see if I can suggest specific optimizations or changes to improve performance.",
