    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, the error message indicates that the test is taking too long to run and is timing out after 600 seconds.\n\nOne possible solution is to optimize the algorithm to avoid the timeout. This could include reducing the number of loops or computations, optimizing data structures, or finding more efficient ways to perform necessary operations.\n\nIf the timeout is caused by slow I/O operations, such as reading from a file, you could try optimizing that aspect of the code as well.\n\nAdditionally, you could try splitting the test into smaller sub-tests and running them separately to identify which part of the code is causing the issue.\n\nAnother option is to increase the timeout value of the test, although this is not always advisable as it may mask deeper issues with the code.\n\nUltimately, it's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.",
