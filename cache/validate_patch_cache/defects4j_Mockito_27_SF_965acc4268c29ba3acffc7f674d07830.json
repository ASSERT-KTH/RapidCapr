Make sure that the `initializedSpy` field is properly initialized and that its type is compatible with the type of mock object being reset in the `resetMock` method.\n\n2. Double-check that the `resetMock` method is being called on the correct mock object instance and that the updated mock object is being used correctly afterwards.\n\n3.
