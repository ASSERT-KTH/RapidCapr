    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not resolving the issue. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, I can suggest some potential strategies to resolve the issue and optimize the function:\n\n1. Consider breaking the function into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n2. Use caching, memoization, or memoized recursion to avoid repeatedly computing values.\n3. Use dynamic programming to optimize the computation of the value.\n4. Make sure that there are no infinite loops or edge cases that could cause the function to run indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, consider increasing the timeout limit to give the function more time to run.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and contexts so I can better assist you.",
