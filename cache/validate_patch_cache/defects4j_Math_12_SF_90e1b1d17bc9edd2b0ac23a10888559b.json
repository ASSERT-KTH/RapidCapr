Without having access to the code and the context in which it is being used, it is difficult for me to find the root cause of the error.\n\nHowever, in general, a test timing out after 600 seconds indicates that there is an infinite loop or an excessively long computation. It could also be caused by a deadlock or a resource contention issue.\n\nOne possible solution is to identify the portion of the code that is causing the test to timeout and optimize it for faster execution. Alternatively, the test timeout value can be increased to allow more time for the function to complete.\n\nIf you can provide me with more information about the code and the context in which it is being used, I can give you a better idea of what might be causing the issue and suggest a possible solution.",
