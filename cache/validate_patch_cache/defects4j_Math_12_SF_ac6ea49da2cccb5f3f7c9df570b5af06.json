Since the provided code is missing and the error message suggests a timeout issue, it is possible that the code is stuck in an infinite loop or is taking too much time to execute. \n\nIn order to provide a correct function, I need to see the original code and understand what it is trying to achieve. It might be possible to optimize the code or redesign it to address the timeout issue. Please provide the code for further assistance.",
