    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the timeout issue hasn't been resolved yet. Without seeing the code and knowing more details about the problem, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are a few general tips for dealing with timeout issues:\n\n- Make sure the code is efficient and not taking too much time to execute. Analyze the algorithm being used and consider alternative approaches if necessary.\n- Optimize any loops or iterations, while loops may be faster.\n- Check for any infinite loops or recursive function, that can lead to code stuck in an infinite loop.\n- Break large problems down into smaller sub-problems and parallelize their solutions, but be aware that parallelization generally introduced overhead so this could make the code slower.\n- Increase the timeout time, this can be useful but only to a point as a program that takes too long to execute may not be acceptable.\n\nIf you could provide additional information about the specific code, I could provide more targeted suggestions.",
