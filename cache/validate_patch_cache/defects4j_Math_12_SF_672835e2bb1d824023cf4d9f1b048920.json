    "patch": "I apologize for any confusion. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide a correct function. However, a test timing out after 600 seconds indicates that the function may have an infinite loop or is taking an extremely long time to complete. You can try optimizing the function or using a different algorithm to solve the problem. Another option is to increase the timeout limit on the test to allow for more time to elapse before a timeout error occurs.",
