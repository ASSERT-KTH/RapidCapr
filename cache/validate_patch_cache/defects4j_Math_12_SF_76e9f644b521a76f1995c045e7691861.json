    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, based on the error message, it seems like the code might have performance issues. \n\nOne solution could be to optimize the code to reduce the execution time. For example, if the code is using a loop to iterate over a large number of elements, consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash map or a binary search tree. \n\nAnother solution could be to split the code into smaller functions that perform specific tasks. This can help make the code more modular and easier to test and optimize.\n\nIf you can provide more information or code snippets, I would be happy to provide more specific guidance.",
