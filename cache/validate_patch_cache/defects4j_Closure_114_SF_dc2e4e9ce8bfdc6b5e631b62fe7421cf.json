If the assignment appears in the init expression of a `for` loop, the dependencies are recorded against the `recordNode`, which is the `var` declaration. This is because the `for` loop creates its own scope.\n\n2. If the right-hand side of the assignment is a call expression, the dependencies are recorded against the call expression.\n\n3. In all other cases, the function searches for the JavaScript scope of the assignment. The scope is determined based on the parent node of the assignment:\n\n   - If the parent node is a function declaration, the scope is the function.\n   - If the parent node is the top-level `SCRIPT` node, the scope is the global scope.\n   - If the parent node is a `BLOCK` node that is inside a loop, the scope is the `while`, `do`, `for`, or `for...in` loop that contains the `BLOCK` node.\n   - If the parent node is a `BLOCK` node that is not inside a loop, the function finds the nearest ancestor node that is a function (or the top-level `SCRIPT` node) and sets that as the scope.\n\nThe `findJSScope` function recursively examines the parent nodes of the assignment to determine the JavaScript scope. If the parent node matches one of the known scope types, the function returns that node as the scope; otherwise, it recursively searches the parent nodes until it finds a matching scope type.\n\nI hope this version fixes the issue and passes the failing test case.",
