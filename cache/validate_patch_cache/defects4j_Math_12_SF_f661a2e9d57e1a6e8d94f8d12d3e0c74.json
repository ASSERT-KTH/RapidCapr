    "patch": "It seems that the function is taking too long to execute and is timing out. Without access to the code, I cannot provide a definitive solution. However, here are some suggestions that you can try to fix the timeout issue:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Look for parts of the code that can be made more efficient or use a different algorithm altogether. This might help reduce the execution time and prevent the timeout error.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the function is processing a large amount of data, try reducing the input size to see if that helps. You could also try running the function with smaller inputs to pinpoint where the problem is.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit: If the function cannot be optimized and reducing the input size is not an option, you can try increasing the timeout limit to allow the function more time to execute. However, this should be done carefully as increasing the timeout limit can potentially cause other issues.\n\nAgain, these are just general solutions that might help with a timeout error. For a more specific and effective solution, I would need to see the actual code.",
