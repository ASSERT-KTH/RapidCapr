    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide a precise fix. However, based on the given error message, it seems that the test is timing out after 600 seconds, which indicates that there might be an infinite loop or a computational issue in the code. \n\nOne possible fix is to optimize the algorithm to reduce the computation time. Another solution could be to increase the timeout duration to allow enough time for the test to complete. \n\nIf you can provide the code, I would be happy to take a closer look and provide a more precise fix.",
