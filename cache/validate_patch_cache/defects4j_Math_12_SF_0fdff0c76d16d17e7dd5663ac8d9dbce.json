    "patch": "If the test is still timing out after 600 seconds, it is likely that there are further optimizations that need to be made to the algorithm. Additionally, it could be helpful to break down the code into smaller sub-tasks and try to optimize each one, as well as identifying any specific I/O or computational operations that are causing the slowdown.\n\nWithout access to the full code and context, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general tips for optimizing code that may help resolve the issue:\n\n- Use more efficient algorithms and data structures\n- Avoid unnecessarily nested loops or excessive recursion\n- Minimize copying of large data structures\n- Avoid redundant calculations\n- Optimize any necessary I/O operations, such as reading or writing to files or databases\n- Parallelize computationally intense sections of the code\n\nUltimately, carefully analyzing the code and profiling performance can help identify the root cause of the slow-down and determine the most effective optimizations to apply.",
