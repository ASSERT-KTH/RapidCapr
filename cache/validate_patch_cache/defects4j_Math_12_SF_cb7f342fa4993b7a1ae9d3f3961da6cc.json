    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issue. Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some potential approaches that you can try:\n\n1. Optimize the code: Identify and remove any inefficiencies in the code. Simplify the code as much as possible.\n\n2. Use caching: If the code involves heavy computations, consider caching intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.\n\n3. Parallelize the code: If possible, break the code into smaller, parallelizable chunks that can be executed concurrently.\n\n4. Use optimized libraries: Utilize optimized libraries or algorithms for computationally intensive tasks.\n\n5. Consult with domain experts: Consult with subject matter experts to identify potential optimizations or alternate approaches to the problem.\n\nAgain, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. I apologize for any inconvenience.",
