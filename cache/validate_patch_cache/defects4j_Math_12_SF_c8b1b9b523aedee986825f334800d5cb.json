    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the fixed version did not solve the issue. However, without the code to work with and more details about the error, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nA test timing out after 600 seconds could indicate that the function is taking too much time to execute. In this case, you could try optimizing the function or breaking it down into smaller functions to reduce the execution time. \n\nAdditionally, if the code contains complex logic, it may be difficult to provide a correct function without a more detailed understanding of the problem at hand. Therefore, I would suggest seeking assistance from a more experienced developer or providing more information about the code and the specific error message.",
