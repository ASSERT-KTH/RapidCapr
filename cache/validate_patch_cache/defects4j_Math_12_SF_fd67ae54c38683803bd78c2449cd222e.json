    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not resolving the issue. Without knowing the exact code, test case structure, or specific error messages, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. Here are a few suggestions to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for potential infinite loops or slow-performing code that might cause the test to take too long to execute. If you determine this to be the issue, try refactoring your code to reduce the complexity or optimize the performance. \n\n2. Increase the timeout duration for the test to give it more time to complete. Depending on the testing framework or tool, this could be done either by modifying the implementation or through configuration files like `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.\n\n3. Consider whether the test is too big, and whether it could be split into smaller sub-tests that run faster.\n\n4. If the test involves network or IO operations, double-check that there are no network or connectivity issues.\n\nWithout more information about the specifics of the test case, it's challenging to provide a more precise solution. I hope these suggestions help resolve the issue.",
