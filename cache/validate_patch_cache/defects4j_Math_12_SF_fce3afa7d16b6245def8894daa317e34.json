Without seeing the code and the specific error message, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, I can suggest some possible reasons why the test might be timing out:\n- The function might be taking too long to execute, possibly due to an inefficient algorithm or an incorrect implementation.\n- There might be an infinite loop or a very large input that is causing the function to run indefinitely.\n\nIn order to provide a more accurate solution, please provide the code and any additional error messages that you may have encountered.",
