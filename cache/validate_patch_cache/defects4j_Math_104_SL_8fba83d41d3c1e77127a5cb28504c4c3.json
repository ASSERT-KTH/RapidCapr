The error message suggests that the infill location is looking for a class, interface or enum, which means that a block of code is expected at this location. Since the original buggy line has been removed, it is difficult to determine the exact code that needs to be added at this location. \n\nPlease provide more context or code snippets so that I can provide a more accurate fix.",
