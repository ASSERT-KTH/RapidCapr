    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working. It seems like the test is still timing out after 600 seconds, indicating that there may be a performance issue with the code.\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of the code and test suite, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, here are some general tips that may help performance:\n\n1. Check for any unnecessary or redundant code and remove it as appropriate.\n2. Avoid using complex data structures or algorithms if simpler ones can be used instead.\n3. Optimize loops by minimizing the number of iterations or processing time per iteration.\n4. Use memoization or caching to avoid recomputation of expensive operations.\n5. Consider parallelizing the code to take advantage of multiple processors or cores.\n\nIf these tips do not help solve the performance issue, please provide more information about the code and test suite so that I can provide a more accurate solution.",
