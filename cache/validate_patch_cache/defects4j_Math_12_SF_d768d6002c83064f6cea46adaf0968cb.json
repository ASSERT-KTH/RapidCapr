    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the actual code, it's hard to determine the root cause of the issue. Given the timeout error message, it seems that the function might be performing a very intensive computation, possibly in an infinite loop.\n\nHere are a few general tips that may help to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Ensure that your function has a proper termination condition. If the termination condition is not met, the function may loop infinitely, causing the timeout error.\n\n2. Optimize your code: Poorly written code can also cause timeouts. Try to optimize your code as much as possible, and remove any unnecessary computations or loops.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit: Depending on the complexity of your code, the timeout limit may need to be increased. You can try increasing the timeout limit and see if it helps.\n\nAgain, without seeing the actual code and knowing more about the specific problem, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
