    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult for me to determine the exact issue causing the timeout.\n\nHowever, in general, there are a few strategies that you can try to resolve test timeouts:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm by reducing the number of loops or computations, optimizing data structures, or finding more efficient ways to perform necessary operations.\n2. Split the test into smaller sub-tests and run them separately to identify which part of the code is causing the issue.\n3. Increase the timeout value of the test, although this is not always advisable as it may mask deeper issues with the code.\n\nIt's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution.\n\nIf you can provide more information or the full code, I would be happy to try to assist further.",
