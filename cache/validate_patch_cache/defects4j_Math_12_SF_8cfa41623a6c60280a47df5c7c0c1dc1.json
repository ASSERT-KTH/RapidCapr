In that case, it's likely that there is an issue with the implementation of the function that is causing it to take too much time to run.\n\nWithout seeing the code or the test case, it's hard to say exactly what the issue is. However, some common reasons for functions taking too long to run include infinite loops, high levels of recursion, or inefficient algorithms.\n\nTo provide a more accurate fix, I'll need to see the code and the test case that are causing the problem. Could you please provide those for me to analyze?",
