Without knowing the details of the code, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, a possible reason for the test timing out could be that the function is taking too long to execute or there may be an infinite loop in the code. It might help to optimize the code or look for any excessive recursion in the algorithm. \n\nAlternatively, increasing the timeout limit may help temporarily, but it is advisable to find a more efficient solution to the problem.",
