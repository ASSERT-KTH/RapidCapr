The test is verifying that the Closure compiler preserves the difference between a function returning `undefined` vs a function that does not return a value. However, this behavior does not seem to be reproducible anymore with the latest versions of the Closure compiler.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend changing the test `testIssue291` to something else that better reflects the behavior you want to verify. If you have any specific requirements or functionality that you would like to test, please let me know and I can try to help you come up with a suitable test case.",
