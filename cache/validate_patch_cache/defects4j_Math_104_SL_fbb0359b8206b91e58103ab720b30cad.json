Based on the error, it seems like the infill location is still missing some code that is necessary for the program to compile correctly.\n\nWithout knowing the context of the code, it's difficult to provide an exact answer. Can you please provide more information about the code and the location of the infill? It would be helpful to see the code surrounding the infill as well.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the code, I will do my best to provide an accurate solution.",
