    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. The fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds indicates that the code is taking too long to execute. Here's a possible solution to consider:\n\nYou could try to optimize the code by using a more efficient algorithm, improving the data structures, or parallelizing the computation. It's hard to provide specific advice without knowing more about the code and the problem it's solving, but here are a few general suggestions:\n\n1. Use memoization or dynamic programming: If the function is being called repeatedly with the same arguments, it may be beneficial to cache the results of previous computations. This can help reduce the overall computational cost.\n\n2. Consider using a more efficient algorithm: If the current algorithm is inefficient, consider using a more appropriate algorithm that is better suited to the problem being solved. For example, if the problem involves searching through a large set of data, consider using a binary search instead of linear search.\n\n3. Optimize data structures: The data structures used by the code may be inefficient. Consider whether using a different data structure could help speed up the computation. For example, if the code involves searching through a list, consider using a hash table instead.\n\n4. Parallelize the computation: Some computations can be split into smaller parts and run in parallel on multiple cores. Consider parallelizing the computation if possible, but be aware that this can be complex and may introduce new issues.\n\nAgain, without more information about the code and the problem it's solving, it's hard to give more specific advice.",
