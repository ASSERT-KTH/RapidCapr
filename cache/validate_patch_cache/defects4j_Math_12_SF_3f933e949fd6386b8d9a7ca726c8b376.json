Without seeing the specific code, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function. \n\nHowever, based on the test error you provided, it seems that there is some issue with the calculation of the values being compared. You may want to check the formula being used and make sure it is correct.\n\nAdditionally, the test timing out after 600 seconds may indicate a performance issue in the function being tested. You may want to consider optimizing the code to improve its performance.\n\nIf you provide me with the specific code and any additional information, I would be happy to assist you further.",
