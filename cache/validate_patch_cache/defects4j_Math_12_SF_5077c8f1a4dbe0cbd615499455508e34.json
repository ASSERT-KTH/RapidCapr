    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. It's possible that the function is still not optimal or there may be some other issue causing the timeout error.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm efficiency - Look for ways to optimize the code to reduce the runtime. This could include using more efficient data structures, improving the algorithm, or using parallel computing.\n\n2. Consider splitting the function - If the function is too complex or doing too much, consider splitting it into smaller, more manageable functions. This could help to reduce the runtime and alleviate the timeout error.\n\n3. Use a profiler - Try using a profiler to identify areas of the code that are taking up the most time. This could help to target specific parts of the code that need optimization.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit - If none of the above options work, consider increasing the timeout limit to give the function more time to run. However, increasing the timeout limit is often not a long-term solution and may cause other issues, so it's best to try optimizing the code first.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
