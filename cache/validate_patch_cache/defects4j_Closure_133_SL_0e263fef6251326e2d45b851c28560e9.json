    "patch": "I apologize for the previous infill suggestion not resolving the issue. Based on the test failure, it seems like there is bad position information being recorded and the fix required may not be related to the `getRemainingJSDocLine` method or its return value. Without more knowledge about the code and the test environment, I cannot tell exactly what should be modified. \n\nHere are a few suggestions that could potentially fix the issue:\n\n- Modify the code that records position information so that it correctly maps the position that caused the error.\n- Update the test harness to avoid catching the thrown exception.\n- Check the test input to ensure that there is no unexpected sequence that may cause a failure.\n\nPlease try the suggestions above and let me know if they work or if you require further assistance.",
