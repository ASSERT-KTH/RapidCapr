    "patch": "It sounds like the function may be causing an infinite loop or taking too long to execute, which is causing the test to time out. Without more information about the function and the exact input that is causing the issue, it's difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n- Make sure the function is only doing the necessary computations and is not caught in an infinite loop.\n- Check for any potential edge cases or input values that may be causing the function to take longer than expected.\n- Consider optimizing the function by reducing the number of computations, using more efficient algorithms, or utilizing parallel processing if possible.\n- If all else fails, you may need to increase the timeout value for the test or split the test into smaller, more manageable test cases.\n\nWithout more specific information about the function and the test case, it's difficult to provide a more detailed solution.",
