    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code that is causing the timeout, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, there are a few general approaches that can be taken to address timeout errors:\n\n1. Optimize the code by identifying any unnecessary loops or operations that can be removed.\n\n2. Check for any infinite loops or recursion that may be causing the code to never terminate.\n\n3. Increase the timeout value to allow more time for the code to execute.\n\n4. Divide the task into smaller sub-tasks that can be completed within the allotted time.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details about the code and the operation it performs, I may be able to provide a specific solution.",
