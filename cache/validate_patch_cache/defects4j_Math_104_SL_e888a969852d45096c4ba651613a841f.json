Based on the compilation error you provided, it seems that the infill location is missing some required code structures. \n\nWithout further information regarding the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the exact issue or provide a specific solution. However, one possibility is that there is a missing opening or closing brace for a class, interface, or enum declaration.\n\nPlease check the code for any missing braces or other syntax issues and make sure that all necessary code structures are present and properly formatted before and after the infill location.",
