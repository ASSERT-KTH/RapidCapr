    "patch": "I apologize for the continued issues. Here's a new version of the function that should address all the problems:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n    return Arrays.copyOf(a, a.length);\n}\n```\n\nThis function creates a new array with the same length as the input array, and copies all the elements from the input array to the new array. The new array is then returned as the result, and because it is a copy of the input array, it should have the same values as the input array and not cause any test failures.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any further issues or if you have any questions.",
