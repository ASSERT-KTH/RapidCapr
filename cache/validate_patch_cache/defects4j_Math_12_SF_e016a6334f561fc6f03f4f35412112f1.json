Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing. \n\nHere are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or extremely long iteration times in your code. \n2. Make sure that you are using efficient algorithms and data structures.\n3. Try optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough.\n4. Consider increasing the timeout value for the test to run, if possible.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
