    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Based on the compilation error you provided, it seems like the original function is likely taking too long to run, causing the test to time out.\n\nWithout being able to see the function in question, it's difficult for me to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general strategies for improving the performance of a long-running function:\n\n1. Review the code for any obvious inefficiencies, such as redundant calculations or unnecessary loops, and eliminate them.\n2. Optimize any data structures used in the code to ensure they're as efficient as possible.\n3. Break the code into smaller, more modular functions that can be optimized individually.\n4. Use profiling tools to identify the bottlenecks in the code, and then prioritize optimizing those bottlenecks.\n5. Consider implementing the code in a lower-level language, such as C or Rust, for improved performance.\n\nIf you can provide me with more specific information about the code and the problem it's solving, I may be able to provide a more targeted solution.",
