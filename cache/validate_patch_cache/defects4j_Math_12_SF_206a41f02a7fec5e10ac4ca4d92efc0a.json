    "patch": "Without access to the full code and test suite, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some general recommendations that may fix the problem:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure that the code is not stuck in an infinite loop or running an excessive number of iterations. This could cause the code to hang indefinitely and eventually time out the test. \n\n2. Optimize the code: Check if there are any computations or loops that could be optimized or simplified to increase the code's efficiency and reduce its overall running time.\n\n3. Increase the timeout: If the code is performing a lengthy computation or algorithm that cannot be optimized, it might be necessary to increase the timeout value for the test. Increase it to a value that is reasonable for the amount of computation required by the code.\n\n4. Check for memory leaks: If the code is creating new objects or allocating memory, make sure that it is properly deallocating them when they are no longer needed. Memory leaks can cause the code to become slower over time as more and more memory is consumed.\n\n5. Use profiling tools: Using profiling tools, such as VisualVM or JProfiler, can help identify performance bottlenecks and memory leaks within the code.\n\nIf the issue persists, you may need to consider seeking additional assistance from a more experienced developer or seeking support from the software provider.",
