    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not resolving your issue. Without any code or additional information, it is hard for me to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, a timeout error typically means that the function is taking too long to execute. Here are a few things that you can try to fix the issue:\n\n1. Try optimizing your code to reduce its execution time. For example, you can try implementing a more efficient algorithm or reducing the number of iterations in your loop.\n\n2. If your function is performing I/O operations, consider buffering the I/O operations to reduce the number of system calls.\n\n3. If your code is dependent on external services, check if the service is running correctly or if it is taking too long to respond.\n\n4. Increase the timeout duration of the test case.\n\n5. If none of the above steps work, consider splitting your function into multiple smaller functions and test them individually.\n\nIf you can provide the code causing the error or any additional information about the issue, I will be more than happy to help you identify and resolve the issue.",
