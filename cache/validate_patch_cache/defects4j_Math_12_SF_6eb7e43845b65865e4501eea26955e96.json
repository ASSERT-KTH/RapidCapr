    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without knowledge of the code and test implementation, it would be difficult for me to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it appears that the test is timing out after 600 seconds. This suggests that the implementation may be taking too long to execute and is likely causing the test to fail. \n\nOne recommendation would be to try optimizing the implementation to reduce the execution time. This could include things like reducing the number of loops or optimizing any calculations.\n\nAlternatively, you can try increasing the timeout limit for the test to give it more time to complete. The specific steps to do this may vary based on the testing framework you are using. \n\nI apologize for any inconvenience and hope this information is helpful.",
