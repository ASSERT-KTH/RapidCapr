    "patch": "I'm sorry for the confusion in my previous response. If the error message is \"class, interface, or enum expected\", it is likely caused by a missing or misplaced `{` or `}` in the code. \n\nWithout seeing the full code, it is difficult to determine the exact location of the missing or misplaced `{` or `}`. However, here is a general approach you can take:\n\n1. Check the line number where the compilation error occurs.\n2. Look at the line above and below the error line to see if there are any missing or extra `{` or `}`.\n3. If you can't find the issue, try commenting out some parts of the code above the error line to see if the error goes away. If it does, you can narrow down the location of the issue.\n4. Once you find the missing or misplaced `{` or `}`, add or remove it as appropriate.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please provide the full code and the exact location where the compilation error occurs, and I will do my best to help.",
