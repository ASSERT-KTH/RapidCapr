Based on the new error message, it appears that the issue may be related to a different part of the code that is using the `resetMock` function.\n\nWithout more information or context about the test failures and the rest of the codebase, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, here are some possible suggestions:\n\n1. Check if there is any other method or code that is trying to spy on the `initializedSpy` object. If that is the case, you may want to modify the `resetMock` function to correctly handle spied objects.\n\n2. Another possibility is that the error is caused by the way the `initializedSpy` object is being created or used in the test. You may want to check if there are any issues in the test code that is causing this error, or modify the test to not use the `initializedSpy` object.\n\n3. It is also possible that there is a bug in the Mockito library itself, in which case you may want to try updating to the latest version of Mockito or reporting the issue to the Mockito development team.\n\nI hope this helps you in resolving your issue.
