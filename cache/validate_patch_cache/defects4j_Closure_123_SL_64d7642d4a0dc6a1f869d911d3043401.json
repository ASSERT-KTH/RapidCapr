    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion and for the incorrect suggestion in my previous responses. The issue is not related to the import statement or the variable initialization.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems that the issue is caused by a syntax error in the code. Since I do not have the full context of the code, I cannot be certain of the exact location or nature of the error.\n\nHowever, I suggest checking for any missing brackets or semicolons in the code prior to the infill location. Additionally, check if there are any incomplete method or class declarations that might be causing the error.\n\nIf you provide me with more context or specific error messages, I'd be happy to provide a more accurate solution.",
