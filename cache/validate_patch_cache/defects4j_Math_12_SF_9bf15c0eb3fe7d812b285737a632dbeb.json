Without access to the code or more information about the specific issue causing the timeout, it's difficult to provide a solution.\n\nHowever, here are some tips to try and resolve the timeout issue:\n\n1. Check the code for any infinite loops or recursive calls that may cause the code to run indefinitely.\n\n2. Try optimizing the code by reducing redundant operations and improving the overall algorithm efficiency.\n\n3. Use a profiler tool to identify any performance bottlenecks in the code and address them.\n\n4. Consider breaking down the function into smaller, modular functions to make it easier to debug and optimize.\n\n5. If the function interacts with an external resource, such as a database or network, consider caching data locally to reduce the overall latency and improve performance.",
