    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing.\n\nHere are some general tips that may help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Consider optimizing your code for performance. Look for ways to make your code more efficient by reducing the number of iterations or improving your algorithms.\n2. Check for infinite loops or extremely long iteration times in your code. Sometimes, small mistakes in your code can cause it to run indefinitely or take much longer than expected to complete. \n3. Consider splitting your code into smaller, more manageable functions. This can help make your code easier to understand and debug, and can also help you isolate performance issues to specific sections of your code.\n4. Increase the timeout for the test to run, if possible.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
