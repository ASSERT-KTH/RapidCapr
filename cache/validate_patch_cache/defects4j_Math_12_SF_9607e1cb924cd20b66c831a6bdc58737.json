Without seeing the code and understanding what it is trying to accomplish, it is difficult for me to provide the correct function. \n\nHowever, the fact that the test is timing out after 600 seconds suggests that there may be an efficiency issue with the code. It could be helpful to analyze the code to see if there are any areas that could be optimized to improve its performance.\n\nAlternatively, it could be helpful to break the code down into smaller functions and test each function individually to isolate any issues and make debugging easier.",
