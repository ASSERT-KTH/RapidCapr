    "patch": "I apologize for the delay in providing a solution for the timeout issue. Based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is taking too long to execute. Here are a few tips to help optimize the code and reduce the execution time:\n\n1. Use caching: If there are portions of the code that are executed repeatedly with the same or similar inputs, consider using caching to avoid redundant calculations and speed up the code.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary operations: If there are unnecessary operations or conditions in the code, removing them can help optimize the code and improve performance.\n\n3. Use parallelization: If there are portions of the code that can be executed in parallel, consider using parallelization to take advantage of multi-core processors and speed up the code.\n\n4. Optimize algorithms: If the code is using inefficient algorithms, optimizing them can help reduce the execution time.\n\nWithout the actual code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you could provide me more context about the code and the specific test that's timing out, I can look into it and provide a more tailored solution.",
