    "patch": "I apologize for the trouble. Without more information, it's difficult to say why the test is timing out. However, here's a possible fix to the bug you mentioned earlier:\n\n```\npublic static List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> list) {\n    return list.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `distinct` method of the `Stream` API to remove duplicates from a list of integers and return a new list.\n\nIf the test is still timing out, there may be other issues with the code or the environment in which it's running. Further investigation would be necessary to determine the cause of the timeout error.",
