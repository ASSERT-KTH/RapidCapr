    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solutions. The error message you provided suggests that the code is taking too long to complete and is causing the test to time out.\n\nWithout more information on the specific code and context, I cannot provide an accurate solution. However, here are some general tips to improve the performance of your code and prevent timeouts:\n\n1. Optimize your algorithms and data structures. Look for any unnecessary loops, recursion, or operations that could be replaced with more efficient ones.\n\n2. Use memoization or dynamic programming techniques to store intermediate results and avoid repeating calculations.\n\n3. Implement multithreading or parallel processing to divide the workload across multiple threads or processors.\n\n4. Use profiling tools such as a profiler or visualization tool to analyze the performance of your code and identify any bottlenecks or resource-intensive operations.\n\n5. If all else fails, you can try increasing the time limit for the test or optimizing the test suite to reduce the number of tests that need to be run. However, this should be a last resort and only done if absolutely necessary.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful in improving the performance of your code and resolving the timeouts.",
