    "patch": "I apologize for any inconvenience. Without seeing the specific code you are working with, it is difficult for me to provide a comprehensive solution. However, here are some possible suggestions:\n\n1. Consider optimizing your code. Are there any areas where you can improve the efficiency of your algorithm or reduce the amount of time it takes to execute? \n2. Check for infinite loops or other issues that are causing your code to take too much time to complete. \n3. Try using a different approach or data structure that may be better suited to your problem. \n4. Consider increasing the hardware resources available to your program, such as increasing the memory or CPU capacity.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help resolve the issue, please provide more details about your code and the specific error message you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
