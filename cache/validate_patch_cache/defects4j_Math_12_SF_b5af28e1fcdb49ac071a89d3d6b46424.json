However, I can suggest some potential strategies to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for potential infinite loops or recursion that might not terminate.\n2. Look for any other resource constraints such as memory usage limits that might be exceeded.\n3. Try refactoring the function to simplify it or make it more efficient.\n\nIf you're still experiencing difficulties, please provide more information and contexts so I can better assist you.",
