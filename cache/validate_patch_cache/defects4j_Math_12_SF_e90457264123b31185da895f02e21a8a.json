    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It sounds like your code is running into a timeout issue. One possible solution is to optimize the performance of your code, or consider a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough.\n\nWithout knowing the specific code being used, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate fix for the issue you are facing. If you can provide more information about your code and the specific test error you are encountering, I will do my best to assist you further.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Review your code to ensure that it is implementing the most efficient algorithm possible for the problem at hand.\n\n2. Remove any unnecessary loops or conditions that may be slowing down your code.\n\n3. Consider using data structures that are optimized for your use case.\n\n4. Profile your code to identify the parts that are taking the most time to execute, and focus your optimizations on those parts.\n\n5. Parallelize your code if possible, so that multiple cores can be utilized for performance improvement.\n\nOnce again, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
