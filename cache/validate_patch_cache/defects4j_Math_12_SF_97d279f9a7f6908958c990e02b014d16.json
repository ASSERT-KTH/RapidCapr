Unfortunately, without the original code, I cannot say for certain what the issue is.\n\nHowever, you can try optimizing or refactoring the code to improve its performance. For example, you can try reducing the amount of data being processed or improving the algorithm or data structures used.\n\nIf you can provide more details about the code and the input data, I can try to provide more specific advice.",
