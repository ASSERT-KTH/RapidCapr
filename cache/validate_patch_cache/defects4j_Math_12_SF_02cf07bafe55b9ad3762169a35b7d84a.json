    "patch": "I apologize for the previous fix not resolving the issue. Without additional information, I am unable to provide a specific solution to the timeout error. However, I can offer some general suggestions to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: Make sure there aren't any loops that can run indefinitely. This can cause the code to hang indefinitely and result in a timeout error. Look for conditions that can cause a loop to run forever, such as an incorrect loop variable increment or a break statement that is never triggered.\n\n2. Optimize your code: If the code is processing significant amounts of data, it may help to optimize the code for better performance. Look for areas where the code can be optimized, such as minimizing the number of iterations or reducing the number of calls to external services.\n\n3. Use a profiler: A profiling tool can help identify the areas of the code that are consuming the most time and resources. This can help pinpoint areas for optimization and reduce the likelihood of timeout errors.\n\nI hope these suggestions help resolve the issue with the timeout error. However, if you could provide additional information or code snippets, I may be able to offer more specific suggestions.",
