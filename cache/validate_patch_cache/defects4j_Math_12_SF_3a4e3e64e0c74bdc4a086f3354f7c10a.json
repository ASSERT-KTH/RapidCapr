However, based on the error message provided, it seems like the solution is taking too long to execute and is timing out.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try optimizing the solution to make it more efficient. This could involve using more efficient algorithms or data structures, or finding ways to reduce the amount of computation required by the solution.\n\nIf you would like more specific guidance on how to optimize your code, please provide me with the full code and I will do my best to help you.",
