    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. Without seeing the code snippet, it is not easy to find the solution. However, the timeout error suggests that the function may be taking too long to execute. \n\nTo fix this issue, you can try optimizing the function by reducing the number of loops or iterations if possible. Alternatively, you can try increasing the timeout value. \n\nIf you can provide me with the code snippet, I can help you in fixing the bug more appropriately.",
