    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect solution. Since the code is not provided, I cannot say what the issue is. However, I can provide a general solution to handle the case when a test times out.\n\nWhen a test times out, it means that the test is taking longer than the allowed timeout duration. This could be due to a slow execution or an infinite loop in the code. To fix this issue, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Identify the test that is timing out and note the input or scenario being tested.\n\n2. Run the same test locally and add some logging statements to understand how long each step takes and identify the slowest part of the code.\n\n3. Once you've identified the slowest part of the code, optimize it or try a different approach that would result in better performance.\n\n4. If the issue is an infinite loop, add conditions to exit the loop when necessary.\n\n5. If all other options fail, increase the timeout duration for the test.\n\n6. Once you've made the necessary changes, run the test again to confirm that it is no longer timing out.\n\nI hope this helps. If you can provide me with more information or the code for the function, I can help you find a specific solution.",
