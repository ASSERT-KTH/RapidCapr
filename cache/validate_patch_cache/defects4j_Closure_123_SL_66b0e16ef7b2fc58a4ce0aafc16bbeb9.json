Without full context of the code and the exact infill location, it was difficult to provide an accurate solution. \n\nTo fix the \"error: illegal start of type\" compilation error, please make sure that the infill location is correct and that the added statement is syntactically correct. It's possible that there might be a missing semicolon or a closing brace somewhere in the code before the infill location, which is causing this error.\n\nIf you could provide me with the full code or the code snippet surrounding the infill location where the statement was asked to be fixed, I might be able to provide you with a more accurate solution.",
