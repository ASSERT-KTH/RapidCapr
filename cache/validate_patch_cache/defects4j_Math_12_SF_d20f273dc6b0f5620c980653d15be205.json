    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code or the complete error message, I can only provide general suggestions for fixing the timeout error. Here are some potential solutions you can try:\n\n1. Optimize the code: One possible reason for the code's slowness is inefficient algorithms, data structures, or operations. You can try to optimize the code by analyzing and profiling it to identify performance bottlenecks and possible improvements.\n\n2. Increase the timeout limit: If the test itself is valid but takes longer to complete than expected, you can increase the timeout limit for the test. In JUnit, you can do this by adding the `timeout` parameter to the `@Test` annotation. For example, `@Test(timeout = 1000)` sets the timeout limit to 1000 milliseconds.\n\n3. Divide the test into smaller sub-tests: If the problem is caused by one single test that takes a long time to complete, you can consider dividing it into smaller sub-tests. This can help you isolate the problem and run faster, more focused tests.\n\n4. Run the test on a faster machine: If none of the above solutions work, you can try running the test on a faster machine or a machine with more resources. This can help you determine whether the slowness is caused by the code itself or the test environment.",
