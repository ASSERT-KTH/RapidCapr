    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. It seems that the code is taking longer than expected to run and causing the test to time out. Here is an updated version of the function that should fix the issue:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n    double[] b = new double[a.length];\n    System.arraycopy(a, 0, b, 0, a.length);\n    return b;\n}\n```\n\nThis version of the `distributionClone` function should create a new array `b` of the same length as `a` and copy the elements from `a` to `b` using `System.arraycopy`. This approach should be much faster than using `Arrays.copyOf` and should not cause the test to time out. Let me know if you have any further issues or questions.",
