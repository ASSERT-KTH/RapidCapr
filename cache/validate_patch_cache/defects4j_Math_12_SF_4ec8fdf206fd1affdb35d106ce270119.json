    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code, it is difficult for me to provide you a correct function. \n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems like the test is taking too long to execute and eventually timing out. This could be due to a performance issue in the code or an infinite loop. \n\nI suggest trying to optimize the code by identifying any bottlenecks, reducing unnecessary operations, or implementing an algorithm with better time complexity. You can also try debugging the code to identify where the test is getting stuck and finding a way to fix it. Additionally, you can increase the timeout value for the test if necessary. \n\nIf you can provide me with the code, I can attempt to help you further.",
