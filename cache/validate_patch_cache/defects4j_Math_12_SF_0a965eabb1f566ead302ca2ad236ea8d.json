    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for letting me know about the timeout error. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the exact issue. However, given the timeout error, it's likely that the function is taking too long to run or is stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere are some general tips to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the function - Look for any inefficiencies in the code and try to optimize them. This could include using better algorithms, optimizing loops, or using more efficient data structures.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops - Look for any loops that are not correctly terminating and causing the function to get stuck.\n\n3. Use debugging tools - Try using debugging tools to identify where the function is getting stuck and why it's taking so long to run.\n\n4. Simplify the function - If the function is too complex, consider simplifying it or breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n\n5. Increase the timeout limit - If none of the above options work, consider increasing the timeout limit to give the function more time to run.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
