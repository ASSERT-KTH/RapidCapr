    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. It seems like the previous solution did not work as expected. Without looking at the code, it is difficult for me to identify the exact cause of the issue. However, I can suggest some possible solutions to fix the 'Test timed out after 600 seconds' error:\n\n1. Try to optimize the code by reducing the execution time of the test. You can use profiling tools to identify any performance bottlenecks in the code and fix them.\n\n2. Check if the test is running an infinite loop or if there is some other condition that could cause the test to run indefinitely.\n\n3. Increase the timeout limit of the test if possible, though you should only do this if you are confident it won't cause any issues.\n\n4. Check if there is any external dependency that the test relies on and make sure that it is available.\n\n5. Make sure that the test is running on a platform that meets the necessary requirements for the code to work properly.\n\n6. If none of these solutions work, consider refactoring the test or the code to make it easier to debug and troubleshoot.\n\nIn any case, please share the code, if possible, to help me understand the issue better and come up with a more specific solution.",
