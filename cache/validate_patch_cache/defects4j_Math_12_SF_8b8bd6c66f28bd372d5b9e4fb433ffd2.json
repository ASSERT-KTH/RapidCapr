    "patch": "Without seeing the actual code and tests, it is impossible to provide a definite solution to this issue. However, a test timing out after 600 seconds indicates that the code is likely inefficient or stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere are some general tips to improve code efficiency and prevent infinite loops:\n\n1. Avoid nested loops wherever possible.\n2. Ensure that any loops have a clear exit condition based on some input parameters.\n3. Use proper data structures and algorithms that are optimized for the problem being solved.\n4. Avoid unnecessary operations and calculations.\n5. Use debugging tools to identify any errors or infinite loops in the code.\n\nIf you provide me with more information regarding the specific code and tests, I may be able to provide more specific advice.",
