    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without access to the code and test cases, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, based on the error message you provided, the code may be taking too long to execute.\n\nTo address this issue, you could try optimizing the code by identifying any inefficiencies or redundant computations that could be eliminated. Another approach could be to parallelize the code if possible or reduce the size of the input data being processed.\n\nAdditionally, you could try using profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the code. This will help you to pinpoint the specific areas where the execution time is being consumed.\n\nIt is also possible that the issue may be related to the specific test cases being used. You could try simplifying the test cases or creating new test cases with smaller inputs to identify and isolate the problem.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the inconvenience and hope that these suggestions help in resolving the issue.",
