    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not resolving the issue. Here's an updated implementation that should pass all the tests without timing out:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] a) {\n    if (a == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    int len = a.length;\n    double[] b = new double[len];\n    System.arraycopy(a, 0, b, 0, len);\n    return b;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation checks for `null` input and returns `null` if `a` is `null`. It creates a new `double` array `b` with the same length as `a`, and uses the `System.arraycopy()` method to copy the elements from `a` to `b`. Finally, it returns `b`.\n\nPlease let me know if this solution works for you.",
