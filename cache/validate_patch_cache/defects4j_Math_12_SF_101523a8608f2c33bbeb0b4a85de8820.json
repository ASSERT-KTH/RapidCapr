I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in resolving this.\n\nHere is another implementation of the `normalize` function that should pass all tests:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double[] normalizedDistribution = new double[distribution.length];\n\n    double sum = 0;\n    for (double value : distribution) {\n        sum += value;\n    }\n\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        Arrays.fill(normalizedDistribution, 1.0 / distribution.length);\n    } else {\n        for (int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n            normalizedDistribution[i] = distribution[i] / sum;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return normalizedDistribution;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the cases of a null or empty `distribution` input array, as well as a case where all the values in the array are 0. \n\nThe implementation sums up the elements in the array using a `for` loop and then divides each element by the sum to create an array of normalized values. If the sum of the input array is 0, it fills the normalized distribution array with an equal distribution of the total probability.\n\nI hope this implementation is satisfactory. Please let me know if there are any further issues.",
