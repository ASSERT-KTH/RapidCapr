    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Without the original code and test cases, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, I can provide general guidelines that can help identify and fix such errors.\n\n1. Check for infinite loops and recursion: Infinite loops and recursion can cause the program to become unresponsive and eventually cause a timeout error. Check the code for any loops or recursive calls that may continue indefinitely.\n\n2. Optimize the code: If the code is performing operations on large datasets, it may take a significant amount of time to complete. Optimize the code to make it more efficient and faster. \n\n3. Use proper threading: If the code is performing CPU-intensive operations, it can be executed in a separate thread to prevent the program from becoming unresponsive and timing out.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value: If the code takes longer to execute due to the nature of the problem, you can increase the timeout value to accommodate the execution time.\n\nI hope these guidelines help in identifying and fixing the issue.",
