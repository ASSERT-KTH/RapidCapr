    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion earlier. Without seeing the code, it's impossible for me to provide a specific fix. However, the `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error suggests that the unit test is taking too long to execute. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as an infinite loop, a slow algorithm, or a large input.\n\nTo fix this, you can try optimizing the algorithm or modifying the input such that the test runs faster. If you're still having issues, you may want to consider splitting the test into smaller, more focused tests, or using a testing framework that supports timeouts to catch and fail slow tests automatically.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it's difficult to give more specific advice.",
