It would be helpful if you could provide more information such as the code and test suite causing the error to occur. \n\nWithout that information, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, I would recommend checking if your code contains any infinite loops or blocking calls that may cause the test to time out. Additionally, you can try increasing the time limit for the test to see if that resolves the issue.",
