This difference suggests that the test may be constructed incorrectly and is not correctly accounting for the presence of the `\\0` character in the output string.\n\nAs a workaround, you could modify the expected result in the test to include the proper escape sequence for the null character, like this:\n```\nvar x=\"\\\\0\"\n```\nor\n```\nvar x='\\\\0'\n```\n\nIf this workaround does not work, please let me know and I will investigate further.",
