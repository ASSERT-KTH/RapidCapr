    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts failing to solve the issue and for the delayed response.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking too long to run, and as a result, it is being timed out after 600 seconds. This could be due to several reasons, such as:\n\n1. The algorithm used in the function is not efficient and takes a lot of time to execute. In this case, you need to optimize the algorithm to reduce the runtime.\n\n2. The data size is too large, causing the algorithm to take a long time. In this case, you may need to optimize the data or split it into smaller chunks to reduce the runtime.\n\n3. There could be some other issues with the implementation, such as excessive I/O, network latency or other performance bottlenecks. In this case, you may need to analyze the code to identify and fix those issues.\n\nWithout knowing more about the specifics of the implementation and test, it is challenging to provide a more specific solution. However, you may try the following approaches to optimize the code and reduce the runtime:\n\n1. Analyze the algorithm used in the function and try to optimize it to reduce the runtime. You may use data structures or other techniques to achieve this.\n\n2. Split the data into smaller chunks to reduce the runtime. This can be done by using parallel processing techniques or dividing the data by some logical criteria.\n\n3. Use caching or other optimization techniques to reduce the I/O or other performance bottlenecks.\n\nIf you can provide more details about the code implementation and the specific test that is failing, I can try to provide a more accurate solution.",
