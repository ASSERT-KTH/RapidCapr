Therefore, I would need to see more of the surrounding code to understand the context of the error.\n\nHowever, a common cause of the error \"illegal start of type\" is a syntax error, such as an unmatched or misplaced bracket. So, you may want to check for any syntax errors in the code and ensure that all brackets are properly matched.\n\nIf you could provide more context or code snippets, I can assist you more accurately.",
