    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts not resolving the issue. The timeout error suggests that the function is not efficient enough or is stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of the code, it is difficult to provide a precise solution. However, one approach to resolving the issue is to optimize the function for better performance. Here are some ways to optimize the function or to identify the source of the issue:\n\n1. Use a profiler: A profiler can help in identifying which parts of the code are causing the excessive time consumption. Once the problem areas have been identified, the code can be optimized.\n\n2. Optimize loops and iterations: In cases where large iterations or loops are required, try to simplify the code and optimize the loops. This can include simplifying the logic, breaking the loop early in cases where a condition is met, or using parallelization techniques to reduce overall computation time.\n\n3. Use efficient data structures and algorithms: If the function is consuming too much time processing data, consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms for improved performance.\n\n4. Check for memory leaks: If the function is consuming excessive memory, check for any memory leaks that may be slowing down the code.\n\n5. Optimize I/O operations: In some cases, slow input and output operations such as disk reads and writes can be a major cause of slow code. Try to minimize the I/O operations or optimize them for better performance.\n\nI hope these tips are helpful in resolving the issue with the function.",
