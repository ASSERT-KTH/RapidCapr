There might be an issue with the test itself or the values it's supplying to the function.\n\n2. Consider adding some print statements to the function to see what values it's processing and what values it's returning. This can help identify whether there's a logic error you haven't caught yet.\n\n3. Check whether the failing test is expecting the correct output value. It's possible that the test itself is incorrect or that the expected output was not updated when the function was changed.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please let me know the failing test case and the error message you're receiving, and I'll take a closer look.",
