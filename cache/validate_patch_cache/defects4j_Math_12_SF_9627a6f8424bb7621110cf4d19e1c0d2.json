Without seeing the actual code and complete test suite that you are working with, it's difficult for me to provide a working solution.\n\nPlease try the following steps to address the timeout error and improve the performance of the code:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or recursion in your code. These can cause the program to hang and eventually time out.\n2. Optimize any expensive operations, such as sorting or searching, to reduce their time complexity.\n3. Consider parallelizing any computationally intensive tasks to run them concurrently.\n4. Increase the memory available to your program, as running out of memory can also cause timeouts.\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues after trying these steps, please provide more details about the code, the inputs, and the test suite, and we may be able to provide further assistance.",
