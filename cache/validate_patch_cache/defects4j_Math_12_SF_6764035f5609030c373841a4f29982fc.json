    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, here are some suggestions that may help resolve the compilation error:\n\n1. Optimize the code:\nThe code may be taking too long to execute due to inefficient algorithms or excessive iterations. Try to optimize the code to reduce its complexity by removing any redundant or repeated calculations, or using more efficient data structures and algorithms.\n\n2. Increase the timeout value:\nIf the code is correct, but still takes too long to execute, you may need to increase the timeout value of the test. This should give the code more time to execute and prevent the test from timing out.\n\n3. Parallelize execution:\nIf possible, you could try to parallelize the execution of the code across multiple threads or processors. This can help to speed up the overall execution time and prevent the test from timing out.\n\n4. Use a profiler:\nYou could also use a profiler tool to analyze the code and identify any performance bottlenecks or resource constraints. This can give you an idea of where to focus your optimization efforts in order to improve the code's performance. \n\nWithout more information about the code, it's difficult to provide more specific advice. However, I hope these suggestions help you to resolve the issue.",
