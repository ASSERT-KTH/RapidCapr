    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not resolving the issue. Given the limited information provided, it is difficult to provide a specific solution without knowing the code and the exact problem causing the timeout error. However, here are some general tips and techniques you can try:\n\n1. Use a debugger to step through the code and see if there are any infinite loops or other issues causing the code to hang.\n\n2. Check for any deadlocks or race conditions that could be causing the program to get stuck.\n\n3. Consider rewriting the code to avoid long-running operations or to split up large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\n4. Increase the timeout limit for the test and see if the code completes within that time frame.\n\n5. Ensure that any resources being used by the program are being properly cleaned up and released when they are no longer needed.\n\nAgain, without more specific information, it's difficult to provide a more targeted solution. If you can provide more details or the specific error message related to the timeout, I might be able to provide more specific advice.",
