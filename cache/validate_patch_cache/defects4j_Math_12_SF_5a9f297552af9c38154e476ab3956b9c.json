    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions not working. Without having access to the code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution that resolves the error message.\n\nThe error message indicates that the test method is taking longer than 600 seconds to execute, which means that there is likely an infinite loop or a performance bottleneck in the code. Here are a few suggestions that you could try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Check the code for any obvious infinite loops. These are often caused by incorrect loop conditions or iterations that are not properly defined. If there is an infinite loop, fixing it should help your code execute within the 600s limit.\n2. If your code performs any I/O operations, check that they are optimized. Issues like multiple file reads/writes, networking, or inefficient database calls can increase the execution time of the code.\n3. Consider using profiling tools to identify which sections of the code are causing the test to fail, so you can optimize those parts of the code.\n4. Increase the timeout limit for the test to a higher value if necessary. However, this is not recommended for production-level code and should only be used as a last resort.\n\nIf you could provide me with access to the code, I could help you better understand the issue and suggest a more specific solution.",
