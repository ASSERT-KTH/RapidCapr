It seems like I did not provide a correct infill line.\n\nWithout seeing the entire code file it's difficult to say where exactly the infill location is. However, given the error you're seeing, it appears that the infill location might be outside of a class or interface definition, or there might be a syntax error in the code.\n\nTo fix the compilation error, we need to identify and fix the syntax issue. Can you please provide more code or information about the location of the infill line?",
