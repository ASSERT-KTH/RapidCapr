    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake. Without additional information or access to the codebase, it's difficult to provide an accurate fix. However, based on the error message you've provided, it's likely that there is a syntax error in the code, possibly involving an equals sign (=) that is being used incorrectly.\n\nTo provide a fixed hunk, I recommend reviewing the code carefully and checking for any syntax errors or typos, especially around any assignments or comparisons involving equal signs. Once you've identified the issue, you can make the necessary corrections to the code to resolve the error.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide me with more details about the code and the error, such as the specific line of code that is causing the error and any relevant diagnostic information, and I can try to provide more targeted suggestions for how to fix the issue.",
