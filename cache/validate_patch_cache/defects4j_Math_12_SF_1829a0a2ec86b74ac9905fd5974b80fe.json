    "patch": "I apologize that the previous solutions did not work. Without additional context or code, it is difficult to provide an exact solution. However, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the function may be taking too long to run and causing the test to time out.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider optimizing the code by reducing its time complexity. Here are some strategies you can try:\n\n1. Use memoization to cache values and avoid redundant calculations.\n2. Simplify complex calculations or use lookup tables if possible.\n3. Break the problem down into smaller sub-problems and solve them iteratively or recursively.\n\nIt's also important to ensure that the function is correctly implemented according to the requirements and constraints of the problem.\n\nIf you can provide additional information or code snippets, I would be happy to assist you further.",
