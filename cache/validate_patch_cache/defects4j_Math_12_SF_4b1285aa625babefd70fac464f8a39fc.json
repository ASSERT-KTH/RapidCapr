    "patch": "I apologize for my previous attempts. Without seeing the code implementation, I cannot provide a specific solution to the problem with certainty. However, the test failure is likely due to the function taking longer than the allowed time to complete. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as inefficient algorithms, unnecessary loops, or large input sizes. \n\nTo resolve this issue, optimizations may be made to the code to reduce its complexity and runtime. Specific strategies may include:\n\n1. Utilizing more efficient data structures or algorithms that have a lower time complexity.\n\n2. Minimizing the number of loops and conditionals where possible, and reducing the number of operations performed inside of them.\n\n3. Avoiding excessive memory usage by using data structures with smaller data footprints or by creating smaller data chunks and utilizing them as needed.\n\n4. Trying to resolve the issue with a less complex solution and reducing the dependency on external resources, data, or services.\n\nOnce potential optimizations have been made to the code, retesting can be done to see if the solution meets the required runtime performance constraints.",
