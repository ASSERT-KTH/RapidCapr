    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that my previous solution still did not work. Without the actual code and more context, it's difficult for me to provide an accurate solution that addresses the test timeout issue. However, here are a few general tips for handling test timeouts:\n\n1. Check the test code. Make sure each test is only testing one specific behavior or feature of the code. If a test is doing too much, it could time out. Additionally, check for any infinite loops or recursive calls that could also cause a timeout.\n\n2. Optimize the code. If the code is slow or inefficient, it could cause the tests to time out. Consider using profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.\n\n3. Increase the timeout duration. If the code is simply taking longer than 600 seconds to execute, increasing the timeout duration could be a temporary fix. However, it's important to identify the root cause of the issue to ensure the tests are running efficiently.\n\n4. Use parallel test execution. If the tests are IO-bound or CPU-bound, consider using parallel test execution using a build tool like Maven or Gradle. This can dramatically reduce the time it takes to run the tests.\n\nIf providing the actual code and error messages, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
