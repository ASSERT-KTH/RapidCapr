    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Without seeing the code itself and understanding more about the test timing out, it is difficult for me to provide a definitive solution. However, I can offer some general tips for resolving code that causes tests to time out:\n\n1. Try to identify the specific part of the code that is causing the delay. This could be due to an inefficient algorithm, a large data set, or other issues. Once you have identified the bottleneck, you can work on optimizing that specific section of the code.\n\n2. Consider breaking the code up into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help with both readability and performance. It may also make it easier to identify and isolate specific issues.\n\n3. Look for ways to optimize the code's performance. This could involve adjusting the way that data is being stored or processed, or using more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n\n4. Finally, consider reaching out to others in the community for help. It can be helpful to get input from others who have experience with similar issues. Stack Overflow is a great place to start.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.",
