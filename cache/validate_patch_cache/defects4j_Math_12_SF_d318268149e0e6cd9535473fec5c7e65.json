However, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it's possible that the algorithm is too slow for the given input size. \n\nHere are a few general tips to optimize the code and improve its performance:\n- Use more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n- Avoid creating unnecessary objects inside loops.\n- Minimize the number of branches and conditionals in the code.\n- Try to precompute or reuse results where possible.\n- Monitor memory usage and consider ways to reduce it.\n- Parallelize the computations where possible.\n\nIf you could provide me with more details about the code and/or the test, I might be able to suggest a more specific fix.",
