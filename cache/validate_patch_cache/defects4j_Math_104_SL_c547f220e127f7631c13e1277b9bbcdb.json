As the infill location is now empty, I will provide the correct line for you:\n\nBased on the information you provided, the error message suggests that there is a syntax error in your code and that a class, interface, or enum was expected at that location.\n\nWithout any additional information or context about the code file that the buggy line was removed from, it is difficult to provide a specific solution to the problem. Please check the file for any syntax errors or missing components, and make sure that there are no other errors before and after the infill location. Also, ensure that all opening and closing braces, brackets, and parentheses are correct and properly matched. Once you have resolved any syntax errors, the code should be compilable.",
