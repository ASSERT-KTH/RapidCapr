Without seeing the code and understanding the context of the test, it's difficult for me to accurately diagnose the issue and provide a solution.\n\nTo help resolve the `Test timed out after 600 seconds` error, you can try increasing the timeout limit in the test framework configuration or optimizing the function/code to run faster.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code snippet that is causing the issue, I may be able to further assist you in finding a solution.",
