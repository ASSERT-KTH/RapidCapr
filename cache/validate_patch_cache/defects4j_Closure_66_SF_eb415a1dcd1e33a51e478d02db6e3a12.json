For example:\n\n   ```java\n   String myString = \"This is a \\\"string\"; // incorrect\n   String myString = \"This is a \\\"string\\\"\"; // correct\n   ```\n\n3. If there are any comments in the code that contain single quotes, make sure they are properly escaped. For example:\n\n   ```java\n   // This is John's comment // incorrect\n   // This is John\\'s comment // correct\n   ```\n\nOnce the code compiles without errors, we can move on to fixing the bug in the `getTypedPercent` function.
