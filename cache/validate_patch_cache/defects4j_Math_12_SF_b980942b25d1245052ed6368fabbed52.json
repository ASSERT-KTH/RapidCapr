Without the specific code causing the timeout error, I am unable to provide a specific solution. \n\nHowever, a common reason for a test to time out is due to inefficient algorithms, or excessive resource usage. In order to address this, you could try optimizing the code, reducing the size of the data being processed, or using more efficient algorithms.\n\nIf you can provide me with more details about the code causing the timeout error, I may be able to offer a more specific solution.",
