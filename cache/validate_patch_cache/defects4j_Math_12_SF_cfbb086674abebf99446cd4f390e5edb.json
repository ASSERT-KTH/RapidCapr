    "patch": "I apologize for the continued errors. It is likely that the function implementation may be taking too long to execute, causing the test to timeout. Without seeing the actual code and test case, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the problem.\n\nHowever, if you would like to try an alternate approach, you could consider using a different algorithm or optimizing the existing code to improve its execution time. Alternatively, you could try modifying the test case to reduce the amount of input data or limit the number of test iterations.\n\nPlease let me know if you require further assistance.",
