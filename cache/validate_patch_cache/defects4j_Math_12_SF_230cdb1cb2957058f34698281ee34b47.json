Unfortunately, without the actual code or additional information about the error, it is difficult for me to provide a solution. \n\nA timeout error typically means that the code is taking too long to execute and is not terminating within a specific time limit. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as inefficient algorithms or infinite loops.\n\nIf possible, can you please share the code or provide more information about the error so that I can provide a better solution?",
