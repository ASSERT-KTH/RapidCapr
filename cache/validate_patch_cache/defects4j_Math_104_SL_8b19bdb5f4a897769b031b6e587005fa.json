    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was some misunderstanding. As an automated program repair tool, I cannot provide a definite solution without having more information about the context of the code or the compilation error message.\n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems that there is a syntax error in the code, and the compiler is expecting to find a class, interface, or enum definition at the line where the error occurred.\n\nWithout more information about the context of the code, it's difficult to suggest a specific solution. However, some common causes of this error include missing curly braces or semicolons, improper indentation, or incorrect use of keywords.\n\nPlease provide more details to help me understand the context of the code and the cause of the error, so I can suggest a more specific solution.",
