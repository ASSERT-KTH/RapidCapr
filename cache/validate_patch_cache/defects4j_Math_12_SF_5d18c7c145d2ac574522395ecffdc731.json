Without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide another solution. \n\nHowever, the \"Test timed out after 600 seconds\" error suggests that the test may be taking too long to execute. One possibility is that the function being tested is stuck in an infinite loop. Another possibility is that the function is processing an extremely large amount of data and causing the test to run for an unnecessarily long time.\n\nTo fix this issue, you could try optimizing the function being tested, using more efficient algorithms or data structures. Alternatively, you could split the test into smaller, more manageable tests.",
