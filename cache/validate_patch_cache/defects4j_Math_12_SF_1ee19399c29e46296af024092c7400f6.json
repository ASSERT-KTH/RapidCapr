    "patch": "I apologize that the previous solution did not work. Without seeing the specific code, it is difficult for me to provide a correct function. However, I can suggest the following steps to help debug and fix the issue:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or other performance issues in your code. Consider using a profiler or other debugging tool to identify any bottlenecks.\n2. Review the test cases to ensure that they are not too complex or have unexpectedly long running times.\n3. Consider optimizing your code for performance, or using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough.\n4. If possible, increase the timeout value for the test to allow for longer running times.\n5. If none of these steps work, consider seeking help from a colleague or mentor who has experience with similar issues.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. If you have any further questions or details about your specific code, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.",
