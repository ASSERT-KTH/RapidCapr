    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that my previous attempt was not successful. Without seeing the code and test implementation, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, based on the error message you provided, it seems that the test is still taking too long to run, and eventually, the test times out after 600 seconds. This is a sign that there may still be some issues with the algorithm used in the function.\n\nTo address this issue, you may need to further optimize the algorithm used in the function. Some possible strategies for optimization may include:\n\n1. Analyzing the algorithm to identify slow or inefficient components and optimize them. This could involve replacing slow loops with faster ones, reducing the number of calculations, or using more efficient data structures.\n\n2. Implementing a caching mechanism to store intermediate results and prevent recalculation of the same values repeatedly.\n\n3. Parallelizing the algorithm to take advantage of multi-threading and reduce the runtime.\n\n4. Reducing the complexity of the algorithm, if possible, by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components.\n\nAdditionally, you could try increasing the timeout limit of the test or running the test on a machine with higher processing power.\n\nWithout knowing more about the specifics of the implementation and test, it is challenging to provide a more specific solution. If you could provide more details, I can try to provide a more accurate answer for you.",
