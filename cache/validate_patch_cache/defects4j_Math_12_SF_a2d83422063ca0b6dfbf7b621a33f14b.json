    "patch": "I apologize for my previous solutions not working. Unfortunately, without seeing the actual code, I cannot provide a specific solution to fix the compilation error. However, I can suggest some general debugging tips that may help determine the root cause of this issue:\n\n1. Check if there is an infinite loop in the code that is causing the test to time out.\n2. Inspect the code for recursive calls that may be causing stack overflow.\n3. Increase the timeout threshold to see if the test can complete successfully.\n4. Use a debugger to step through the code and see where it might be getting stuck.\n5. Check the system resources ( CPU and memory usage) to make sure they are not being exhausted during the test run.\n\nAgain, I apologize for not being able to provide a specific solution, but I hope that these tips can help you isolate and fix the issue.",
