    "patch": "I apologize for the error. Without seeing the code and knowing the requirements and specifications, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive solution. However, I'll do my best to offer a potential solution.\n\nThe timeout error usually occurs when the program is in an infinite loop or taking too much time to execute a particular task. In this case, the test seems to be taking longer than expected (over 10 minutes). It could be due to a performance issue in the code.\n\nTo fix this, you could try optimizing the code and improving its performance. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops in the code and fix them\n2. Use efficient data structures and algorithms\n3. Parallelize the code if possible\n4. Optimize any database queries or network calls\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please share the code snippet or more information on what the code is trying to accomplish, and I can provide more specific advice.",
