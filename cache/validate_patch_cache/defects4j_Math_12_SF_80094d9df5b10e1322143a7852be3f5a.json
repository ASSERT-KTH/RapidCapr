    "patch": "Without the actual code and more information about the error message, it's difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general tips for resolving timeout errors:\n\n1. Review the code to identify potential inefficiencies or infinite loops. Check for any loops that may be executing more iterations than necessary.\n\n2. Make sure the code is properly optimized. Look for any redundant or unnecessary code blocks and remove them.\n\n3. Ensure that all external resources such as databases, APIs, and networks are properly configured and responsive.\n\n4. Increase the maximum runtime limit for the test.\n\n5. Divide the test into smaller, more manageable units and run them separately to better isolate the source of the error.\n\n6. Check if the test is being run in an appropriate and efficient environment. For instance, running the test in a memory-constrained environment can lead to timeout errors.\n\nHopefully, one or more of these tips will help you to resolve the issue and ultimately pass the affected test.",
