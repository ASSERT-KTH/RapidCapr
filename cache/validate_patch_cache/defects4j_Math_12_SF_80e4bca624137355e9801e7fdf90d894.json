It seems that the function you provided may have an infinite loop or perform some expensive computation that is causing the test to time out.\n\nWithout additional information on the code and test suite, it is difficult for me to provide an accurate solution. However, I recommend breaking up the computation into smaller chunks or adding progress-reporting statements to help pinpoint where the error may be occurring.\n\nAdditionally, you can try increasing the time limit for the test or optimizing the code to improve its performance.",
