    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts. It seems that there may be a larger issue in the code. Without seeing the implementation, I can only provide a general debug strategy:\n\n1. Check the input parameters: Make sure that the input values are within the correct range and format. Verify that any required dependencies are properly initialized.\n\n2. Check for off-by-one errors: Ensure that all loops and conditionals properly iterate over all relevant values or include all relevant boundaries.\n\n3. Check for race conditions: Verify that any shared variables are properly synchronized and that any threads have access to the resources they need.\n\n4. Monitor memory usage: Check for potential memory leaks or inefficient use of resources.\n\n5. Logging and debugging: Add console output or logging statements to help identify where the code is getting stuck and what the values of relevant variables are at various points in the execution.\n\nOnce a specific issue is identified, it can be addressed through targeted code changes or rearchitecting. I hope this helps in identifying and fixing the issue.",
