Here is the updated code that should fix the issue:\n\n```\nimport org.json.JSONArray;\nimport org.json.JSONException;\nimport org.json.JSONObject;\n\npublic class JSONUtils {\n\n    public static double getTypedPercent(JSONArray arr) {\n        int total = arr.length();\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {\n            try {\n                JSONObject obj = arr.getJSONObject(i);\n                if (obj.get(\"type\").equals(\"typed\")) {\n                    count++;\n                }\n            } catch (JSONException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n        return (double) count / total * 100.0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines the `JSONUtils` class and includes the necessary `import` statements. The `getTypedPercent` method takes in a `JSONArray` and iterates over its elements. If an element is a `JSONObject` with a `\"type\"` property equal to `\"typed\"`, it increments a counter `count`. Finally, the method returns the percentage of elements in the array that were `\"typed\"`. This is calculated by dividing `count` by `total` and multiplying by 100.\n\nI hope this resolves the issue. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.",
