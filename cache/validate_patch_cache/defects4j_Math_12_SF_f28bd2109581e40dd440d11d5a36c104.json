    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the previous fix did not work either. Without seeing the code or understanding more about the issue, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution. However, here are a few things that you could try:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops: The timeout error could be caused by an infinite loop within the code. Make sure the code exits properly by adding break conditions where necessary.\n\n2. Optimize the code: Similar to the previous solution, try to make the code more efficient by reviewing the algorithms being used and refactor if necessary. Consider using caching, memoization, or other techniques to reduce computation.\n\n3. Use parallelism: If the computation being performed is very complex, then it may be possible to split it into smaller parts and run them in parallel. This can help reduce the overall execution time.\n\n4. Increase the timeout: If none of the above options work, you might consider increasing the timeout limit to give the code more time to execute.\n\nWithout more information about the code and requirements, it's difficult to provide a specific solution.",
