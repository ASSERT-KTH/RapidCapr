    "patch": "I apologize for the incorrect infill suggestions. Based on the test errors you are seeing, it seems that the issue is more complex than a single infill can fix. Here are some potential explanations for the test errors and some suggestions for how to fix them:\n\n1. The `computeFollowNode` function may not be correctly handling all possible control flow paths, leading to incorrect results for some code paths. One thing to try is to step through the function using a debugger or print statements to see if you can identify which parts of the function are causing incorrect behavior. Then, you can try to modify those parts to handle the missing cases.\n\n2. There may be bugs or missing features in the `ControlFlowAnalysis` class that is used by the `computeFollowNode` function, leading to incorrect control flow computation. If this is the case, you may need to modify or extend the `ControlFlowAnalysis` class to fix the bugs or add the missing features.\n\n3. There may be bugs or missing features in other parts of the code that call the `computeFollowNode` function and use its results to generate control flow edges or perform other operations. If this is the case, you may need to modify or extend those parts of the code to fix the bugs or add the missing features.\n\nWithout more information about the specific codebase you are working with and the test cases that are failing, it's difficult to provide more specific guidance on how to fix the issues you are seeing. However, I hope these suggestions are helpful in identifying and resolving the problems with your automated program repair tool.",
