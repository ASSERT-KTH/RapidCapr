    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. Unfortunately, without seeing the actual code that is causing the timeout error, I cannot provide a specific correction. It is possible that the function is getting stuck in an infinite loop or performing a large number of operations that is taking longer than expected. To address this, you may consider optimizing the code to improve its performance or finding an alternative approach that is more efficient. If you can share the code that is causing the timeout error, I may be able to provide more specific guidance on how to proceed.",
