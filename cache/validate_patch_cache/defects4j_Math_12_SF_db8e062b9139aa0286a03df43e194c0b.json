    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solutions that did not work for you. Please try the following implementation:\n\n```\npublic static double[] normalize(double[] distribution) {\n    if (distribution == null || distribution.length == 0) {\n        return new double[0];\n    }\n\n    double sum = Arrays.stream(distribution).sum();\n    if (sum == 0) {\n        return new double[distribution.length];\n    }\n\n    return Arrays.stream(distribution).map(d -> d / sum).toArray();\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation handles the cases of a null or empty `distribution` input array, as well as a case where all the values in the array are 0. \n\nThe implementation uses the `Arrays.stream` method to sum up the elements in the array and then divide each element by the sum, using the `map` method to apply the quotient to each element. The `toArray` method is then used to create a new double array to hold the normalized values.\n\nI hope this implementation resolves the issue you were facing. Let me know if you have any further questions.",
