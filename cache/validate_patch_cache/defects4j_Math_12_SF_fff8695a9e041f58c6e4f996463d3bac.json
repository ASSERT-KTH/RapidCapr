    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. A timeout error means that the test is taking too long to complete, and increasing the timeout value is not a permanent solution. \n\nTo solve the issue, you need to optimize the code so that it completes within a reasonable time frame. Here are some possible areas to optimize:\n\n1. Look for nested loops or recursion that might be causing the code to take a long time to complete. \n2. Check if there are any unnecessary calculations or operations that can be removed or optimized. \n3. Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks, such as slow IO or frequent object creation.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you can provide more details or code snippets, I would be happy to take a closer look and try to help you further.",
