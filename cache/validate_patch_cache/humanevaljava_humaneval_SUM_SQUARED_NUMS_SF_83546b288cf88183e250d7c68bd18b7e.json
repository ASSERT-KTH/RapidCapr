The line `result += (Math.floor((int) lst[i])) * (Math.ceil((int) lst[i]));` uses the `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` functions on an integer value that is cast from a double value, which results in the same integer value. Therefore, the multiplication of the same integer value will always produce a squared integer value.\n- The above calculation can be simplified to `(int)lst[j] * (int)lst[j]`, but it still doesn't produce the correct result.\n\nThe proposed fix function:\n- Initializes the `result` variable as a `long`.\n- Uses a enhanced for loop to iterate over the `lst` array, which is simpler and clearer.\n- Uses the `Math.round` function to round each element of `lst` to the nearest integer, which is the expected behavior based on the test case. It then squares this value and adds it to the `result` variable.\n- Returns the `result` value.\n\nThis fix function produces the correct result on the given test case, and should work for any input array of double values.",
