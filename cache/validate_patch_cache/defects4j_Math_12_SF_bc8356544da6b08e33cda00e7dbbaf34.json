Without knowing more details about the code and the specific test case, it is difficult to provide an accurate solution. \n\nHowever, here are some general tips that may help:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops or very long computation times in your code.\n2. Make sure that your code is using efficient algorithms and data structures.\n3. Try optimizing your code for performance. Consider using a different approach if your current method is not efficient enough.\n4. If possible, consider increasing the timeout value for the test to run.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, please provide more information about your code and the specific error you are encountering, and I will do my best to assist you further.",
