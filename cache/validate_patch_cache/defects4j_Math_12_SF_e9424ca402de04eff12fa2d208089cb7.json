This error suggests that the function is taking too long to execute, rather than a compilation error. \n\nWithout seeing the original code, it's difficult to know what is causing the function to take so long. However, you may want to consider optimizing the code or using more efficient algorithms to speed up the execution time. \n\nIf you can provide more information, such as the input values or any error messages, I may be able to offer a more specific solution.",
