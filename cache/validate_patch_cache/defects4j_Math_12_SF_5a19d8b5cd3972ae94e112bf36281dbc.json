    "patch": "Without access to the full code and context, it's difficult to provide an exact solution. However, given the compilation error, it's possible that the code is still running into an infinite loop or performing excessive computations that are causing the test to time out.\n\nTo address this issue, I would suggest reviewing the code and identifying any areas where it's performing unnecessary computations or where it could be optimized to improve its performance. It's also worth checking if the variables and structures used for computations are correctly initialized and declared.\n\nAdditionally, you could try increasing the timeout value of the test to allow the code more time to execute. However, this is not a solution and won't address the underlying issue of excessive computations.\n\nIf the problem persists, it may be necessary to seek further assistance and carry out a more in-depth analysis of the code.",
