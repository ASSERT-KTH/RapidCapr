    "patch": "I apologize for the previous solution not solving the problem. Without access to the original code and more information on the issue, it is difficult for me to provide a specific solution.\n\nHowever, here are some general steps you can take to fix the timeout error:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or repeated computation in your code. If any loop runs for an excessive number of iterations, the code can take longer to complete.\n2. Optimize your algorithm and consider using efficient data structures to improve the efficiency of your code.\n3. Add log statements to your code to check which part of the code takes longest time to execute. This may help you identify potential issues that cause the code to take longer than expected.\n4. Increase the timeout time for your test case. You can do this by changing the timeout parameter of your test case.\n\nIf you can provide more information about the specific problem and code that is throwing the timeout error, I would be happy to assist you further.",
