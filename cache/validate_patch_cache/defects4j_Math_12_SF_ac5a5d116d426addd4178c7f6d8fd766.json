    "patch": "It's difficult to provide a correct function without seeing the full code and understanding the context of the problem. However, here are some general tips to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Check that the function is not stuck in an infinite loop. One way to do this is to add logging statements inside the function to see where it gets stuck.\n\n2. Ensure that the function is handling all possible input paramaters and producing the correct output values.\n\n3. Check that there are no race conditions in the code that could be causing long wait times.\n\n4. Increase the timeout value of the test, if possible. However, be aware that this may not fix the underlying issue and may only mask the problem.\n\nIt's important to investigate and analyze the root cause of the issue to prevent it from recurring. If necessary, it may be helpful to consult with colleagues or seek advice from more experienced developers.",
