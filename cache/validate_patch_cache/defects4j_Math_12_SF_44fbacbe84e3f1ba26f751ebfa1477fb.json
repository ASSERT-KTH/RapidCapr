    "patch": "I apologize for my mistake earlier. Given the error message you provided, it seems that the test is taking more than 10 minutes to execute and therefore timing out. This could be due to an infinite loop or some other performance issue. \n\nWithout more information about the code and the test, I cannot provide a specific solution. However, you can try the following approaches to debug the code and isolate the issue:\n\n1. Use a debugger to step through the code and see where it is getting stuck. \n2. Simplify the test by reducing the input size or complexity to see if the issue is related to a specific input value. \n3. Add logging statements to the code to track the progress and identify where it is taking too long. \n4. Check the system resources such as CPU and memory usage to see if they are being exhausted during the execution of the test. \n\nOnce you have identified the root cause of the issue, you can fix the code or adjust the test accordingly.",
