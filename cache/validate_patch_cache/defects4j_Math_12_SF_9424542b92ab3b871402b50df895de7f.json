    "patch": "If the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it's likely that the algorithm has an efficiency issue and is taking too long to run. Without more information about the specific algorithm and inputs being used, it's difficult to provide a specific fix. However, some potential solutions could be:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: Look for ways to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, such as reducing the number of loop iterations, using more efficient data structures, or parallelizing the computation.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the algorithm is taking too long to run on large inputs, consider reducing the input size to a more manageable size. This could involve reducing the number of test cases, or decreasing the size of the data elements being processed.\n\n3. Increase the timeout: If neither of the above solutions work, you may need to increase the timeout value for the test to complete successfully. However, this should only be done as a last resort and should be accompanied by efforts to optimize the algorithm and/or reduce the input size.",
