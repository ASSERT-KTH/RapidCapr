Here are a few suggestions that might help fix the issues:\n\n1. For the testTextExtents in which the error message is `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Recorded bad position information` it looks like it's a parsing error involving a type annotation that cannot be recognized. We may need to review the code that generates or relies on the said type annotation to identify and correct the error.\n\n2. The test error `junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected warning(s): JSC_TYPE_PARSE_ERROR. Bad type annotation. Unknown type T at externs line 11 : 14` appears to be another parsing error, this time involving the `T` type annotation at line 11 : 14 of the `externs` file. We may need to review the said file and the code that uses it to identify and correct the error.\n\n3. If there's a need to fix the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` code, we may need more information like the code for the `stream` object and how the `getRemainingJSDocLine()` method is being used in the context of the test cases.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.",
