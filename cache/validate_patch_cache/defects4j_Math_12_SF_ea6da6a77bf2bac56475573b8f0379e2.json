Without seeing the specific code causing the error, it's difficult to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, a common cause of a test timing out is either inefficiencies or an infinite loop. It may help to optimize the code and refactor it to use more efficient algorithms. Additionally, it may be helpful to reduce the size of the input data being processed to avoid potential memory issues.\n\nIf you can provide me with the specific code that is causing the timeout error, I can offer a more specific solution.",
