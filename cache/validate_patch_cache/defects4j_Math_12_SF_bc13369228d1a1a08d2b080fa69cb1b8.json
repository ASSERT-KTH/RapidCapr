However, here is an updated version of the function that may resolve the issues causing the timeout error:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution) {\n    final int N = distribution.length;\n    final double[] newDistribution = new double[N];\n    double sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        newDistribution[i] = distribution[i] * N;\n        sum += newDistribution[i];\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n        newDistribution[i] /= sum;\n    }\n\n    return newDistribution;\n}\n```\n\nThis updated implementation should correctly clone the distribution array while preserving its proportions.",
