However, given the error message, I suggest checking if the removed buggy line was defining a variable in the middle of the class or method, since Java doesn't allow such definition (variables are expected to be defined inside a class or method body).\n\nIf it turns out that the removed line was defining a variable outside of a class or method, the correct fix would be to move the variable definition to the appropriate place (e.g. inside a class or method body).\n\nAlternatively, if you could provide me with more information about the code, I could try to suggest a more specific solution.",
