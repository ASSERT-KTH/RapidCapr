    "patch": "I apologize for misunderstanding the issue. It seems that the test is taking too long to complete and is timing out. In that case, you can try the following implementation of the function to improve its performance:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution) {\n    int length = distribution.length;\n    double[] clone = new double[length];\n    System.arraycopy(distribution, 0, clone, 0, length);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the `System.arraycopy` method to create a clone of the input distribution array. This method is more efficient than using a loop to copy each element of the array.",
