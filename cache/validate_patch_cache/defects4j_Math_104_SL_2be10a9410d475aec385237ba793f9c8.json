    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The line `DEFAULT_EPSILON` is not defined in the code you provided, which means that it cannot be used to fix the error. \n\nBased on the error message you provided, I suspect that the infill location is expecting a class, interface, or enum declaration, but instead found some other kind of code (possibly a statement or an expression) that is not allowed in that context.\n\nWithout more information about the specific location and context of the error, I am unable to provide a more specific solution. Could you please provide more details about the code and the error message, or share the code in its entirety so I can better understand the issue?",
