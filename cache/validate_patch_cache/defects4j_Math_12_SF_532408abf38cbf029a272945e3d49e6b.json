    "patch": "I apologize for any frustration caused by my previous response.\n\nAs the error message indicates that the test timed out after 600 seconds, it seems that the function is taking a long time to run or may be entering an infinite loop.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some potential strategies to try:\n\n1. Review the function and look for any loops that may be running too long or infinite loops.\n2. Consider optimizing the function and potentially using more efficient algorithms.\n3. If the function is operating on a large dataset, consider reducing the size of the data being processed or splitting it into smaller batches.\n4. If none of the above strategies work, consider reaching out to your peers or seeking assistance from a more experienced developer.\n\nI understand that this may not be the specific solution you were hoping for, but I hope that these strategies help you resolve the issue.",
