Check for infinite loops in your code and make sure they have a stopping condition.\n2. If you are performing some time-consuming operations in your function, try to optimize your algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n3. If the input size is too large, try to divide the input into smaller pieces and process them separately.\n4. Increase the timeout limit if possible.\n\nIf you provide me with the code, I can try to give you a more specific solution.",
