Without seeing the full code file, it's difficult to provide exact guidance. \n\nBased on the error message you provided, it seems like the infill location may be missing a required class, interface, or enum declaration. It's possible that a previous edit to the code removed or misplaced one of these declarations. \n\nTo address the error, you should review the code file and ensure that all class, interface, or enum declarations are properly formatted and in their correct locations. You may need to add missing declarations or move existing ones to correct locations.\n\nWithout further information or the code file, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. Please provide more context or the full code file if you require additional assistance.",
