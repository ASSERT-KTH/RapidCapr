Here are a few general strategies you can try:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops in your code that may never terminate.\n2. Ensure that the algorithm you have used to solve the problem has the necessary time complexity to pass the test. You may need to optimize your code to improve performance.\n3. Run your code using a profiler to identify which part of the code is taking the most time to execute. You can then optimize that part of your code.\n4. Increase the allocated timeout period for your test case if none of the steps above resolve the issue.\n\nI suggest trying these steps to determine why the test is taking too long to complete. If you can provide more information, such as the code or additional error messages, I will be able to give you more specific assistance.",
