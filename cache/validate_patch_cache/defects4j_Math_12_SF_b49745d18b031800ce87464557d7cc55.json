    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. It seems there is still an issue with the code that's causing a timeout. Without seeing the actual code, it's hard to determine the root cause of the issue. However, here's a possible implementation of the function that you may try:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution) {\n    double[] clone = new double[distribution.length];\n    for(int i = 0; i < distribution.length; i++) {\n        clone[i] = distribution[i];\n    }\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation creates a new double array with the same length as the input array, then copies the contents of the input array into the new array using a simple loop. It then returns the new array.",
