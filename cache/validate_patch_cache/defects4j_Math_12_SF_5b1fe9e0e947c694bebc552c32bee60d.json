    "patch": "I apologize for the issues you're facing. Without more information about the code and the specific test cases causing the timeouts, it's difficult for me to provide a solution that will fix the code in all cases. However, I can offer some general advice:\n\n1. Optimize loops and conditionals: Ensure that loops and conditionals are as efficient as possible. Avoid loops or conditionals that repeat unnecessarily, or that perform unnecessary comparisons.\n\n2. Reduce memory consumption: Limit the amount of memory the code consumes, and avoid creating unnecessary objects or variables.\n\n3. Parallelize code: Consider using parallel processing to distribute the work across multiple threads or processors.\n\n4. Re-architecture: If the code is particularly complex or hard to understand, consider redesigning it to be more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n5. Code profiling: Use a profiling tool to identify bottlenecks and resource-intensive sections of the code. This can help identify where improvements can be made.\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if there is any further information I can provide to help diagnose and fix the issue.",
