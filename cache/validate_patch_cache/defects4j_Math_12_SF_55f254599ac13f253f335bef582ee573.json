Here is another proposed solution:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distribution(double[] arr) {\n    double[] expArr = new double[arr.length];\n    double expSum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        expArr[i] = Math.exp(arr[i]);\n        expSum += expArr[i];\n    }\n    double[] resultArr = new double[arr.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        resultArr[i] = expArr[i] / expSum;\n    }\n    return resultArr;\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we compute the sum of all exponential values first to ensure that we don't add numbers that are too small to the sum. Next, we divide each exponential value by the sum to obtain the final distribution. I hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you continue to face any issues.",
