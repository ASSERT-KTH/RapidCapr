Without seeing the code or knowing more information about the problem, it is difficult for me to provide a correct solution. \n\nHowever, if the test is timing out after 600 seconds, it may be an indication that the code is taking too long to execute. You may want to consider optimizing the code to reduce its overall runtime.\n\nAdditionally, you could try increasing the timeout duration for the test if you believe that it should take longer than 600 seconds to complete. This can typically be done through the testing framework or IDE that you are using.\n\nIf you have any other specific details about the code or problem, please let me know and I will do my best to provide a solution.",
