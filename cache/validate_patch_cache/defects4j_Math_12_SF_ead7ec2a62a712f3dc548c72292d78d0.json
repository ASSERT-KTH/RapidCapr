    "patch": "If the test is timing out, it is likely due to an inefficient algorithm in the function. Without seeing the code, it is difficult to provide a specific solution, but there are a few general solutions that could help:\n\n1. Use a more efficient algorithm: Identify if there is a more efficient algorithm that can accomplish the same task. There may be ways to optimize the algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If the function is given large inputs that are causing it to time out, consider reducing the input size by limiting the range of values or reducing the number of elements in the collection.\n\n3. Optimize the code: Review the code to look for opportunities to optimize performance. Are there any unnecessary loops or inefficient operations? Can any of the code be refactored to run more efficiently? Are there any specific bottlenecks that can be optimized?\n\nWithout seeing the code and understanding the specific requirements and constraints of the function, it is difficult to provide a more specific solution.",
