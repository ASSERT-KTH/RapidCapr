    "patch": "I apologize for the timeout error. Without seeing the original code or the context of the test, I cannot provide a specific fix. However, I can suggest some possible approaches to help fix the issue:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm: If the test is timing out, it may be because the algorithm has a high time complexity. You can try to optimize the algorithm to reduce the execution time. \n\n2. Increase the timeout limit: If the algorithm is complex and cannot be optimized further, you can increase the timeout limit for the test. \n\n3. Divide the test: If the test is testing multiple cases or inputs, you can divide the test into smaller tests. This way, each test can have a smaller input and a shorter execution time.\n\n4. Debug the test: If none of the above approaches work, you can debug the test to identify the source of the problem. Use a debugger to execute the test step by step and see where the execution is taking too long. \n\nI hope one of these approaches helps you fix the issue. If you can provide more information or the original code, I can try to provide a more specific solution.",
