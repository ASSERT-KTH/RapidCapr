However, without knowing the details of the code and the context, it is difficult to provide an accurate fix.\n\nThe error message you're seeing suggests that the test is taking too long to run, so it's likely that the function is computationally expensive and needs to be optimized. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops in the code and make sure that termination conditions are properly set.\n\n2. Try optimizing the code using more efficient algorithms, data structures, or parallelization techniques.\n\nIf you could provide me with the code and some more context, I might be able to provide a more specific solution.",
