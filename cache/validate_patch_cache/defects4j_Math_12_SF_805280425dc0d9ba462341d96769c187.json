    "patch": "I apologize for the previous response. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide a specific solution to fix the timeout error. However, I can offer some general tips to address timeout issues:\n\n1. Optimize your algorithm: If your code is taking too long to run, it's possible that you're using an inefficient algorithm. Consider improving your algorithm to reduce the time complexity.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: Try reducing the size of the input to your function. If you're testing on large inputs, it's likely to take a long time to complete.\n\n3. Check for infinite loops: Ensure that your code is not getting stuck in an infinite loop. This can cause the program to run indefinitely, leading to a timeout error.\n\n4. Increase timeout limit: Try adjusting the timeout limit for the test. It's possible that the test is set to a very short timeout, causing the code to fail even if it's correct.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. If you can provide more details about the code and the error message, I may be able to provide additional guidance to resolve the issue.",
