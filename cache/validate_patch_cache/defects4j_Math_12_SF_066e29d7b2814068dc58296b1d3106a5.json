    "patch": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous suggestion. It's possible that the timeout error is caused by an infinite loop or similar issue in the code. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to diagnose the exact problem.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general tips on how to address such timeout issues:\n\n1. Check for infinite loops or long-running processes.\n2. Split long-running tests into smaller, more focused tests.\n3. Optimize code to reduce the test execution time.\n4. Increase the timeout limit for the test to give it more time to complete.\n\nIf you can provide me with the code sample, I'll try my best to help you find the issue and fix it.",
