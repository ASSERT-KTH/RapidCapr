Based on the compilation error you provided, it seems that an opening curly brace `{` is still missing for a class, method, or enum declaration.\n\nPlease make sure that all opening curly braces `{` have their corresponding closing curly braces `}` and that they are placed in the correct locations for the code to compile successfully.\n\nIf you provide me with the full code or a more specific error message with the location of the problematic file and line number, I can help you further.",
