    "patch": "I am sorry for my previous incorrect suggestions.\n\nAfter analyzing the error message you provided, I believe the problem may be related to a missing closing parenthesis or other syntax error somewhere else in the code. Without seeing the full code, it is difficult for me to pin down the exact problem.\n\nHowever, the original buggy line that was removed appears to be unrelated to the current error message. Given that, I can suggest the following replacement code to bring back the removed line of code:\n\n```\nContext rhsContext = Context.OTHER;\n```\n\nThis simply initializes the `rhsContext` variable to a specific value.\n\nPlease let me know if this suggestion helps, or if you require further assistance.",
