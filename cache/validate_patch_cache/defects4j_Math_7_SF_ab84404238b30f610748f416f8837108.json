However, I can give you some tips on how to find and fix the issue.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to try and resolve the compilation error:\n\n1. Check for typos and syntax errors: It's possible that there's a typo or syntax error in the code that's causing the compiler to interpret the code incorrectly. Make sure that all braces, parentheses, semicolons, etc. are properly closed.\n\n2. Review the previous code: Sometimes, a compilation error can be caused by a problem earlier in the code than where the error is reported. Check the code surrounding the function in question and see if there are any issues with the variables, imports, or other syntax.\n\n3. Copy and paste the code again: It's possible that there's an invisible character or formatting issue in the code that's causing the compilation error. Try copying and pasting the code again to see if it fixes the problem.\n\n4. Consult a colleague or mentor: If you still can't identify the issue, ask a colleague or mentor to review the code with you. Sometimes, a fresh set of eyes can help identify the problem.\n\nWithout seeing more of the code or the specific error message, it's difficult for me to provide a more specific solution.",
