    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. The test failing with a timeout error suggests that the code may have performance issues and fixing a single function may not be sufficient. However, I can provide some general tips that may help improve the code's performance:\n\n1. Avoid using nested loops where possible, as they can quickly become exponentially expensive.\n2. Consider using data structures like hashes or maps to reduce lookup times.\n3. Avoid unnecessary object creation or method calls.\n4. Use efficient algorithms and data structures where applicable.\n\nIf you can provide more details about the code and the specific test that is failing, I may be able to offer more targeted advice.",
