Here's another implementation that should work and will not result in a timeout:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] currentProb = new double[n];\n    double[] nextProb = new double[n];\n    Arrays.fill(currentProb, 1.0 / n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n        Arrays.fill(nextProb, 0);\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                nextProb[(j + k) % n] = nextProb[(j + k) % n] + currentProb[j] * distribution[k] / n;\n            }\n        }\n        double[] temp = currentProb;\n        currentProb = nextProb;\n        nextProb = temp;\n    }\n    return currentProb;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two arrays, `currentProb` and `nextProb`, to avoid creating a new array at every iteration. At each round, we iterate through the boxes and the balls, and distribute each ball uniformly among all the boxes. We use `currentProb[j] * distribution[k] / n` to compute the probability of moving a ball from box `j` to box `(j+k)%n`.\n\nFinally, we compute the final probability distribution, which is stored in `currentProb`.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
