    "patch": "I apologize for the previous error. Without seeing the code, I cannot provide an accurate solution. However, I can recommend some steps to take in order to address the timeout error:\n\n1. Check the complexity of your algorithm: If you are working with a large dataset or performing a complex operation, the algorithm may take too long to execute. Consider optimizing your code or using a more efficient algorithm.\n\n2. Check for infinite loops: If your code contains an infinite loop, it will never complete and cause a timeout error. Review your code to ensure there are no infinite loops.\n\n3. Increase the timeout duration: Your test may be taking longer than the default timeout duration in your testing framework. Check the documentation for your testing framework and adjust the timeout duration accordingly.\n\n4. Check your environment: The timeout error may be due to a slow or unstable environment. Verify that your system and network are functioning properly. You can also try running the test on a different machine or network.",
