    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that the issue may be with the performance or complexity of the code. If the code takes too long to run or has a large input size, it may cause the test to time out.\n\nWithout seeing the code and understanding the context, it's difficult to provide a specific fix. However, there are some general strategies that can help with performance issues:\n\n1. Use efficient algorithms and data structures: Make sure that your code is using the best algorithms and data structures for the problem at hand. If a more efficient algorithm can be used, it may drastically improve the performance of the code.\n\n2. Avoid unnecessary operations: Look for any operations that may be computationally expensive or unnecessary, and try to optimize or eliminate them if possible.\n\n3. Limit the input size: If the code takes too long to run on large input sizes, consider limiting the input size or breaking it up into smaller pieces.\n\n4. Parallelize the code: If the code can be parallelized, consider using multithreading or distributed computing to speed up execution.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code or understanding the context, it's difficult to provide a specific fix. If you can provide more information about the code and the context, I may be able to offer more specific advice.",
