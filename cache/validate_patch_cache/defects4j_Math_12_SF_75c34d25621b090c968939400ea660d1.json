    "patch": "I apologize for the incorrect solution earlier. Without knowing the exact code or the context of the error, it is difficult for me to provide a correct solution.\n\nFor the \"Test timed out after 600 seconds\" error, it typically means that the test is taking too long to complete and is therefore timing out. There are a few possible solutions:\n\n1. Optimize the code being tested to reduce its execution time.\n2. Increase the timeout duration for the test, if possible.\n3. Split the test into multiple smaller tests to reduce the execution time per test.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the code and the test, I may be able to provide a more specific solution.",
