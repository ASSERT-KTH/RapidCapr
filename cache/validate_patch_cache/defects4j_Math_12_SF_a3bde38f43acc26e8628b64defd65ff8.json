    "patch": "I apologize for the previous attempts not resolving the issue. It seems like the function is taking a long time to execute or is stuck in an infinite loop, causing the tests to time out.\n\nWithout seeing the code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue, but I recommend the following steps to help diagnose and fix the problem:\n\n1. Check for any infinite loops within the function that might be causing the tests to hang. Consider reviewing the control flow of the function to ensure that all exit conditions are being met.\n\n2. Consider optimizing the algorithm used in the function. If the input size is large, the current implementation may not be suitable.\n\n3. Ensure that the implementation matches the requirements and be sure to test with multiple test cases.\n\nIf you would like more specific help, please share the implementation of the function and the tests you are running and I'll be glad to assist you.",
