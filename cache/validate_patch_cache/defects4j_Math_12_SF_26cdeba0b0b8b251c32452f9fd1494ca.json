    "patch": "I apologize for my previous response. Without having more information or access to the code and test suite, it's difficult to determine the exact issue or provide a working solution. \n\nHowever, based on the error message, it seems like the test suite is taking too long to execute and eventually timing out after 10 minutes (600 seconds). This could indicate an error in the test suite that is causing it to enter an infinite loop or perform an excessive amount of calculations.\n\nOne possible solution could be to optimize the test suite by reducing the number of tests or optimizing the code to run faster. Alternatively, running the tests on a more powerful machine or increasing the timeout limit may also help.\n\nIf the problem persists, please provide more information about the code and test suite, including any additional error messages or stack traces, and we can work together to find a solution.",
