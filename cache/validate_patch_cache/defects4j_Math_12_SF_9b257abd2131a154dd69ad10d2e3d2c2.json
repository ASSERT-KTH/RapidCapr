    "patch": "I apologize for the confusion. Since the code still times out, it's likely that the function has an algorithmic complexity or efficiency issue. In order to provide a solution, we'll need more information about the code, including the full context and purpose of the function, any constraints or limitations in the use case and any performance requirements that should be met.\n\nWithout further information, it's difficult to suggest a specific solution. However, some general tips for improving the efficiency of a function include: \n\n1. Reducing the complexity of the algorithm - If the function is performing complex calculations or operations, try to simplify the logic or choose a more efficient algorithm.\n\n2. Limiting the scope of the function - If the function has a broad scope, try to narrow its focus to a specific task or operation that can be optimized.\n\n3. Caching or memoization - If the function is processing data that is reused frequently, consider caching or memoizing the results to save computations.\n\n4. Parallelization - Depending on the nature of the function and the hardware available, parallelization may be a viable option for improving performance.\n\nAgain, without more information, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. Would you be able to provide the full context of the function, any constraints or limitations in the use case, and any performance requirements that should be met?",
