    "patch": "I apologize for the inconvenience. A `Test timed out` error indicates that the test is taking too long to run and needs optimization to reduce its running time. To fix this error, you can optimize your code to run faster by minimizing costly operations and data structures.\n\nHere are some possible optimizations you can apply to your code:\n\n1. Use efficient algorithms and data structures. Avoid using inefficient algorithms such as bubble sort and use more efficient ones such as quicksort or mergesort.\n\n2. Minimize the number of I/O operations. Reading and writing to disk is slow, so try to avoid doing this as much as possible. If possible, keep all data in memory.\n\n3. Reduce the amount of unnecessary computation. Review your code for loops or calculations that are performed repeatedly or on unnecessary data.\n\n4. Parallelize your code. As I mentioned earlier, using parallel processing can greatly improve your code's performance.\n\nWithout more information about your code, it's challenging to provide a more specific solution to the issue you mentioned. However, I hope these optimization tips help.",
