Without seeing the code itself, it is difficult to determine the cause of the error.\n\nHowever, here are some general tips that may help resolve the issue:\n\n- Check for any infinite loops or recursion in the code.\n- Look for any variables or data structures that may be causing excessive memory usage.\n- Try optimizing the code and reducing its complexity if possible.\n- Consider increasing the timeout limit for the test.\n- Check if the test itself is causing the issue and not the code.\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more information about the code and the test that is timing out. This will allow me to provide a more specific solution.",
