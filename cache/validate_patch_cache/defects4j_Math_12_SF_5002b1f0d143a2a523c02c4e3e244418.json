    "patch": "I apologize for the issue. It seems like the implementation I provided is still not efficient enough. Here's a faster implementation of the `equals` method:\n\n```\npublic boolean equals(Distribution other) {\n    final double EPSILON = 1e-9;\n    if (data.length != other.data.length) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    double sumSq1 = 0, sumSq2 = 0, sum12 = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n        double x = data[i];\n        double y = other.data[i];\n        sumSq1 += x * x;\n        sumSq2 += y * y;\n        sum12 += x * y;\n    }\n    double num = sum12 * sum12;\n    double den = sumSq1 * sumSq2;\n    return Math.abs(num / den - 1) < EPSILON;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation computes the Pearson correlation coefficient in a more efficient way by computing only the terms necessary to compute the numerator and denominator of the formula. The `EPSILON` value determines how close the correlation coefficient needs to be to consider the two distributions equal.\n\nI hope this implementation solves the problem.",
