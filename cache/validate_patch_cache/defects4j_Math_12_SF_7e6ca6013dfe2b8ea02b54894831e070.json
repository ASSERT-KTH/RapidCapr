This is another implementation that should work:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] result = new double[n];\n    double[][] dp = new double[m + 1][n];\n    Arrays.fill(dp[0], 1.0 / n);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                dp[i][(j + k) % n] += dp[i - 1][j] * distribution[k] / n;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return dp[m];\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a `dp` array of size `m+1 x n`. At each round, we iterate through the boxes, and for each box, we iterate through all the balls, and distribute them among all the boxes uniformly. We use `dp[i][(j+k)%n]` to store the total probability of having `j+k` balls in `(j+k)%n`-th box at the end of the `i`-th round. We compute the next probability distribution at the end of the current round using the probability distribution obtained at the end of the previous round, which was stored in the `dp[i-1]` row of the `dp` array.\n\nFinally, we compute the final probability distribution, which is stored in `dp[m]`.\n\nI hope this updated solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
