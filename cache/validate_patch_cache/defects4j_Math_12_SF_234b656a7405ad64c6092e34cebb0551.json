    "patch": "I'm sorry to hear that the fix did not work, and it timed out. Without seeing the code and the context, it's difficult to provide a specific solution to this problem. However, here are some possible suggestions:\n\n- Verify that the timeout value is reasonable and not too high or too low.\n- Check if the test is waiting for some resources or is running a long query that is causing the timeout. In that case, you can try to optimize the query or split the test into smaller tests to isolate the issue.\n- Make sure that the code does not have any infinite loops, unnecessary blocking, or thread locks. These issues can cause the test to hang and eventually time out.\n- Check the logs for any error messages or exceptions being thrown during the test, as they could be a clue to the underlying issue.\n- If none of the above works, consider revising your test strategy or test framework.",
