    "patch": "I apologize for the earlier solutions not working as expected. Here's another implementation that should work:\n\n```\npublic static double[] distributionClone(double[] distribution, int m) {\n    int n = distribution.length;\n    double[] newDist = new double[n];\n    double[][] dp = new double[m + 1][n];\n    Arrays.fill(dp[0], 1.0 / n);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n                dp[i][(j + k) % n] += dp[i - 1][j] * distribution[k] / n;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return dp[m];\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation runs in `O(n^2 * m)` time but should not time out for the given constraints. The key difference is that we're no longer using recursion.\n\nThe `dp` array represents the probability distribution at the end of the `i`-th round. We start with the uniform distribution `dp[0]` and compute the probability distribution at each round using the previous distribution and the given `distribution`. The probability of having `j+k` balls in `(j+k)%n`-th box at the end of the current round is obtained using the probability of having `j` balls in `j`-th box at the end of the previous round and distributing the balls among the boxes uniformly.\n\nFinally, we return the probability distribution at the end of the `m`-th round, which is stored in `dp[m]`.\n\nI hope this solution works for you. Please let me know if you have any further issues.",
