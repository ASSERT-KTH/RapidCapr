    "patch": "I apologize for the previous incorrect fixes. To fix the timeout error, try optimizing the algorithm to reduce the time complexity of the function. Here are some additional suggestions:\n\n1. Identify the bottleneck: Use a profiler or logging statements to identify the slowest parts of the code and focus on optimizing those areas.\n\n2. Reduce the input size: If possible, try reducing the input size to the function by removing unnecessary data or restricting the range of input values.\n\n3. Implement parallelism: If the computation is CPU-bound, consider using parallel processing or multi-threading to distribute the workload across multiple cores.\n\n4. Use built-in functions: If the language provides built-in functions or libraries for the operations you need to perform, use them instead of reinventing the wheel.\n\nAgain, without seeing the code, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution, but I hope these tips are helpful.",
