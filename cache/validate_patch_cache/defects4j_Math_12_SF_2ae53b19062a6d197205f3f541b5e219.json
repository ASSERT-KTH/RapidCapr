    "patch": "I apologize for the previous suggestion not working. Without seeing the code or understanding the context of the test case, it is difficult for me to provide the correct solution. However, I can suggest some general strategies for fixing a timeout error:\n\n1. Optimize the algorithm to improve its efficiency. If the function is performing complex calculations or iterating over large data sets, consider whether there is a way to reduce the number of calculations or optimize the data structures being used.\n\n2. Break up the function into smaller, more manageable parts. If the function is complex or performing multiple tasks, consider splitting it up into smaller functions that can be tested separately.\n\n3. Increase the allocated timeout time. If the function is too complex to optimize or split up, you may need to increase the timeout time allocated for the test case.\n\nWithout the code and more information about the problem, it is difficult for me to suggest a more specific solution.",
