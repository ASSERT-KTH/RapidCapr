    "patch": "Considering the error message you provided, it appears that the test is still timing out. In this case, it's likely that the function is still taking too long to run and needs further optimization to avoid the timeout.\n\nIt's difficult to provide a specific solution without access to the full code and context. However, some general tips for optimizing code to avoid timeouts include:\n\n1. Use more efficient algorithms and data structures, such as hash maps or binary search trees.\n2. Reduce the number of computations or operations being performed.\n3. Avoid unnecessary loops or recursion.\n4. Optimize I/O operations, such as reading/writing to files or databases.\n5. Split the code into smaller functions to identify where the bottleneck is occurring.\n\nIt's important to carefully analyze the code and identify the root cause of the issue in order to provide an accurate and effective solution. If possible, try running the function with different input values and see if there are any patterns in the behavior or performance that can be optimized.",
